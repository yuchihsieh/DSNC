[Benjamin Golub] 15:14:43
It doesn't seem like you're… doesn't seem like you're feeling great.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:14:44
Yeah… Yeah, this flu is terrible.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:14:51
don't get it.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:14:51
Are you… are you taking, um… Now, are you taking, like, normal symptomatic?

[Benjamin Golub] 15:14:58
Advil, Tylenol kind of deal.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:15:00
Yeah, yeah, ever since the morning of, uh, Tuesday.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:15:04
Man…

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:15:05
Yeah, I still managed to work for a couple of hours.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:15:08
in the past few days. Not, like, every day, but in total, so…

[Benjamin Golub] 15:15:10
We can take it… I mean, we can take it easy in this meeting. Let me just look at what you… let's do a very… let's keep it light in terms of.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:15:17
texting your brain. Um… I'm gonna… I'm reading your report, okay?

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:15:22
Okay.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:15:35
What is DSNC stand for?

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:15:39
Dynamics… dynamic sparse network on a continuum.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:15:42
Got it.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:15:52
I'm reading all your… Yeah, you can absolutely… how much does cursor cost you a month?

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:15:59
I think it should be less than $100. How much does it cost for you?

[Benjamin Golub] 15:16:04
I don't know, I don't keep close track, somewhere around there. Um… So yeah, you can… you can, um, text Meredith and say, um.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:16:14
and set up, um… you can just email Meredith, admin at, and say Ben said, um, I could.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:16:21
reimburse, um…

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:16:25
Thank you. Yeah, that's the… that's the whole point of this meeting. We can actually end it now.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:16:30
Right. Great. Um… Uh… so…

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:16:36
By the way, by the way, do you… do you set up some sort of, like, automatic process.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:16:41
in which you have multiple agents, and you let them interact with each other.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:16:46
Or not yet.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:16:46
No, for research, it's… I think for papers you're really writing, it's not… like, for… I mean, I do that manual… I do it manually, like, write a plan, write a… I don't know if you watched my… I did a, uh…

[Benjamin Golub] 15:16:59
talk on Marcus Academy, and. So there I talked, like, you know, write a high-level strategy for this proof. Okay, now, you can add steps like, okay, now you're… I make them role-play. I say, okay, now you're…

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:17:01
I did, I did.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:17:11
another senior probabilist. And you're reviewing this plan, like, your audience is… the first senior probabilist, and you're reviewing.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:17:18
You're providing constructive feedback on, like, where this kind of go wrong.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:17:23
Um, and… Um… Uh… And… and that's kind of multiple… but multiple agents… yeah, I know some engineers, like, you could watch videos about how people with plot code set up multiple agents who are, like.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:17:38
doing things, you know, for… I haven't found that useful for research. I think they just go off, go off track.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:17:40
Yeah.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:17:46
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:17:47
Um… does that make sense? Uh, and… Um…

[Benjamin Golub] 15:17:59
Let me just see your… Um…

[Benjamin Golub] 15:18:07
Yeah, um… What are your summer travel aspirations? What would you like to do?

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:18:13
Uh, so… Um… a few… Some more details.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:18:21
So my uncle, he diagnosed… he got diagnosed as.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:18:26
He got diagnosed the last stage cancer 2 years ago.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:18:30
And I don't think there is… there's a lot of time.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:18:34
On his side. I'm thinking of, like. I'm thinking of going back to Taiwan for a month.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:18:41
Mm-hmm.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:18:42
I'm thinking of giving a talk, like, you know.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:18:45
spending some time with him. Um, and, uh, probably giving a talk about this project.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:18:52
in Taiwan, at the end of June, which I've.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:18:56
I've sort of scheduled. Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:19:01
And I know that last summer, I wasn't very productive. I'll make sure that.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:19:07
That doesn't happen this summer. Yeah.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:19:09
Yeah, no, it's totally fine. I think the productivity is really all… yeah, it's… it's about, um… We can talk more about it, I… yeah.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:19:14
Yeah. Okay.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:19:18
It's… but… I…

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:19:21
Yeah, his… I didn't… I didn't actually plan to go back to Taiwan this summer.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:19:26
I remember.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:19:26
I thought that I won't go back all the way until the end of this year, but then… My father just told me several days ago that, you know, if I have time, I should probably go back more often.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:19:37
And I was like… Yeah. That was pretty sad.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:19:37
Yeah.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:19:43
Yeah, yeah, okay. I… I'm very sorry to hear that, of course, so… Okay, but yes, the summer… and then you… are you going to send an applicant… you're going to send… are you gonna… oh, no, you can't go to Hong Kong, so…

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:19:44
Yeah.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:19:53
No, no, I won't go to Hong Kong.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:19:58
Um, and… Yes, I think for this… I think for this quarter, you can class… you can self-classify as a theory.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:20:07
theory student, um… like, you say theory, you're… yeah, uh, the only… How is your project? I wanted to ask you for an update on the Taiwan project with Nancy.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:20:11
Yeah, I'll just focus on this.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:20:19
Oh, so we… we… we did a… we did a pilot. We recruited.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:20:24
more than 1,000 participants. Actually, we received more than 2,000 responses.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:20:30
Mm-hmm.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:20:31
But some of them are definitely buts. Yeah, and so, um, the results are pretty hard to interpret.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:20:38
We were supposed to have a meeting with NC this week, but I was terribly sick, so… Let's move to next week.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:20:45
Got it.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:20:46
that we're going to take a look at the results, and then… We'll probably run an experiment.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:20:51
Yeah, I think… well, those results are very, very weird, but my colleague and I do not know how to interpret them.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:21:00
No. We need some wisdom from Nancy. Yeah.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:21:00
Got it. Makes sense, okay.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:21:05
Yeah.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:21:06
Um, and…

[Benjamin Golub] 15:21:16
Just see…

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:21:16
Yeah, no, I'm more familiar with… for this event project, I'm more familiar with.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:21:22
Uh, non-standard analysis. So, so now, uh, and I think I know… I know… I mean, so… so… Duffy and Son 2007, their first AAP paper.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:21:38
was about one shot. render matching on a continuum of agents.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:21:44
And that, I think I understand 80%, if not 90% of the details, and I'm presenting.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:21:50
them to Kelvin, because Kelvin was on vacation, and.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:21:53
I look forward to giving him a, you know, a high-level wrap-up.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:21:58
Which also includes an introduction to an Australian analysis terminology.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:22:04
And meanwhile, I think after I get better, I'll be working on the continuous diversion, because in order to check.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:22:11
essential pairwise independence. Across multiple time periods.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:22:16
there's a lot of work. in, uh, in a working paper version of… Um, their second AAP paper.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:22:23
And also in the supplement, yeah, so there are, like.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:22:27
But thanks to cursor and, like, all these amazing agents, I have a very dense, um.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:22:28
Do you…

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:22:34
summary of what's… what the paper is about, so I think I can… Yeah, I think I can get a high-level summary first, and then… I'll dig into the details.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:22:46
Because we need to leverage those details in order to build up our own model.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:22:51
Like, in the same language.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:22:54
Do you think that, um… It… just in terms of the sequencing, there's this other stuff, there's the question… I guess, right, for the… it's true that for the… okay, so continuous time seems… seems technical… continuous time seems to have technicalities that discrete time does not.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:23:13
Um, right, like, if you had to order, like, static is easier than discrete time is easier than continuous time, I think, in terms of measure theoretic.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:23:22
And… I wonder if… Um… Yeah. I can see going directly to continuous time. It feels like one thing that I'm… what's network theoretically most interesting.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:23:38
is, uh… this issue of… of… understanding when.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:23:45
the local… this… we had this exchange by email or WhatsApp about.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:23:55
whether the local state needs to be the whole tree.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:23:59
And I still believe that for physics… for physics in.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:23:59
Yeah.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:24:03
It doesn't. And that question can be asked reasonably in discrete time.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:24:07
Because you can have a discrete time SIR model on a continuum sparse random network.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:24:26
So, um, what's the… what's the difference between. Uh… what, um, between the discrete time version of this question and the continuous time version of this question.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:24:37
Oh, just what… no, right, I don't think… I think the different… I don't think, conceptually, there is much difference, and I think that the continuous time version takes a lot more.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:24:46
machinery to. I… yeah, go ahead.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:24:50
How… so, so, so, so basically how Dumphy and Sun.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:24:54
And their co-author did in their second AAP paper, is that.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:24:58
First of all, they'll have to consider finite. period, like, time periods.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:25:03
So that's essentially discrete time. And then… Yeah, and then they do finite agents with finite time periods, and then they take.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:25:05
Uh-huh?

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:25:13
both finite to hyper-finiteness. So that they have, like, continuous time.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:25:18
Right, right. And I guess I'm saying that if you… Wouldn't it be a little easier? Maybe it wouldn't actually be… worth… it would… maybe it wouldn't be a substantial simplification, or… but wouldn't… it seems at least…

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:25:19
And continuum of agents.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:25:34
like, naively would be simpler not to have to worry about the hyper-finiteness in the time dimension.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:25:41
Oh, that's true, that's true. Yeah, yeah. After… after, you know, after you mentioned.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:25:49
this question, I started to wonder why they do not have a.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:25:53
intermediate paper that deals with discrete time. you know, multiple dynamic.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:26:00
multi-dynamic render matching.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:26:02
Yeah, I think there is actually a paper of theirs that does… that has some discrete time, but maybe… Not, um… Then, yeah, so I would… I guess I would… I would… advise… that's my… my biggest advice is try to stay… if you can stay away from the technicalities of complete information.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:26:21
Um… Sorry, if you can stay away from the technicalities of.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:26:24
continuous time. For a little bit, uh, that would be… probably wise, because it can just occupy a lot of time.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:26:35
Right, yeah, in their paper, they have 12mm. Before the proof of that.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:26:41
Yeah.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:26:44
existence of Ubini extension result. Yeah. Yeah.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:26:47
The, uh… oh. Okay, good.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:26:52
And again, I still haven't answered your question, like, I've been thinking of this, like, whether we have to keep track of.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:27:00
You know, on the, like… the whole route is structured.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:27:05
Booted tree structure, or just that agent's type? My intuition is still… that we have to keep track of the whole rooted tree structure, but.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:27:19
But I haven't… I haven't… I haven't made much progress on this yet.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:27:24
Yeah.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:27:24
And just to be clear, let's answer this question without an economic model in the picture, just about a physical transmission process. So think about.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:27:33
like, uh, think about your process with all the choice parameters frozen at.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:27:37
exogenous values, like… And then, I claim… I claim that to write the… to write the local physics at any moment, you just need the node's local state.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:27:39
Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:27:51
And so, if that's wrong, I would… I would love… yeah, I think settling that one way or the other would be very useful, but in order to make the question even… even… mathematically well-defined, you need a discrete time.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:28:03
So, so… so, so in their, in their, uh, continuous time.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:28:04
version.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:28:08
Paper. Um, Asians, like. they have to keep track of not only.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:28:16
not only Ben's type, but also whether Ben has a match.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:28:21
And if Ben does, then who, uh… what Ben's mattress type is.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:28:29
Um, right, but I guess what I'm saying is that to predict, just to… work out the physics of the model.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:28:36
If you… It's not… so to work out the instantaneous probability of me getting infected.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:28:42
Uh, I don't… you don't need any of that other info… Ah, so, okay, maybe… maybe, actually, there is a difference between discrete and continuous, because what we said in the… in our meeting, we made this observation that.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:28:48
Cause…

[Benjamin Golub] 15:28:54
if it's continuous time. then basically, higher order, yeah, so if it's continuous time, then no two events never happen. Like, in the short run, the only.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:29:07
Uh… maybe this is even… okay, yeah, but in the continuous time setting, my getting infected in time in the next time instance?

[Benjamin Golub] 15:29:13
It really does only depend on whether my neighbor is infected right then.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:29:17
Right? Like, there… none of these higher order, nothing that happens beyond your immediate neighborhood has a first-order impact on your… on the infection rate.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:29:19
Yeah.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:29:27
I see, I see. You're saying the… you're saying that there might be 100.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:29:30
I might have 100 infected friends. But… I… say that I have another, say, 200 uninfected friends at the moment.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:29:41
And whether they're very likely to be infected or not.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:29:44
doesn't really matter to me, because those are, like, second order.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:29:46
Exactly.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:29:48
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it, I get it, but… I was… what I was thinking of this, I was thinking of that.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:29:55
I was thinking from a… Marco perspective, like… you know, you probably need the whole rooted tree structures so that the rate matrix.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:30:04
is gonna be Markov, in that sense. I don't know.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:30:06
Well, but… no, but yeah, but I believe that the right Markovian type for each agent.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:30:12
Yeah, like, the question is… It's a… right.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:30:16
the whole rooted trees, in some sense. in there… no way, the whole rooted tree is eventually playing a role indirectly. Like, once you have all the local relationships, of course the whole rooted tree will matter for the full to determine the full dynamics, but.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:30:21
intrautable? In there.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:30:32
The point is that the kernel… what is the smallest object? The question is really, what is the smallest.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:30:37
object that's sufficient to generate all of that, and I believe it's just.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:30:42
a map, it's just some kind of local type. So, in any case, that's the question. Why don't we just make your research goal for our next meeting, you give me.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:30:52
Um, and you may have to, you know, you give me an answer to that question, and… It may be that you, that you developed the continuous time.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:31:02
uh, math, at least… To some degree, to make that possible.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:31:09
But you don't have to do it… I'm saying you don't have to complete it by the next meeting, but like… Like, okay, um, are you around… On Tuesday.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:31:11
Okay, yeah. Yeah.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:31:22
Yeah, yeah, we can meet that.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:31:24
Let's meet Tuesday afternoon at 2.15 PM.

[Yu-Chi Hsieh] 15:31:29
2.15, okay. I'll send you an invite right now.

[Benjamin Golub] 15:31:31
Great. Okay, and mostly, yeah, for now, just rest, feel
