Fubini extension: Sun 2006 and DS 2007

26.01.07
* discussed with GPT about internal sets --- why they are important to nonstandard analysis
* 1st round understanding DS 2007 --- Fubini extension (By Keisler's thm) and then show essential pairwise independence: finite combinatorics -> hyperfinite O(1/N) -> infinitisimals -> independence
* Goal tmr: DLS 2025, continuous time matching!

26.01.08
* Brief understanding of DLS 2025. More work to do to understand the details next week!

26.01.09
* Setup PROJECT.md
* both notes polished by "note revision" agent
* Met with Ben. Next week to-dos listed.

26.01.11
* Reread DS07 Static and prepard pre to Kelvin.

26.01.12
* Study DS07 Discrete-time: properties, things before the existence proof.

26.01.13
* Study DS07 Discrete-time: the existence proof.
