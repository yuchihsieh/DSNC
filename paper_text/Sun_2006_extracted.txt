Abstract
A Fubini extension is formally introduced as a probability space that extends the usual product
probability space and retains the Fubini property. Simple measure-theoretic methods are applied to
this framework to obtain various versions of the exact law of large numbers and their converses for a
continuum of random variables or stochastic processes. A model for a large economy with individual
risks is developed; and insurable risks are characterized by essential pairwise independence. The usual
continuum product based on the Kolmogorov construction together with the Lebesgue measure as
well as the usual ﬁnitely additive measure-theoretic framework is shown further to be not suitable
for modeling individual risks. Measurable processes with essentially pairwise independent random
variables that have any given variety of distributions exist in a rich product probability space that can
also be constructed by extending the usual continuum product.

1. Introduction
The intuitive idea of the complete cancelation of individual risks through aggregation or
diversiﬁcation has been widely used in the economic literature.1 The underlying mathe-
matical model usually involves a continuum of random variables or stochastic processes
that are stochastically independent. It is hypothesized that almost all sample functions are
Lebesgue measurable with a common mean or distribution.
2
As noted in [4,13,19], it is easy to construct examples of a continuum of independent
random variables whose sample means or distributions are constant. However, one can
also construct other examples of a continuum of independent random variables whose
sample functions may not be measurable, or behave in a very “strange” way. In fact, for
an i.i.d. process based on the usual continuum product via the Kolmogorov construction,
one can obtain the absurd claim that almost all sample functions are essentially equal to an
arbitrarily given functionh on the index space (see Proposition 6.1 below and the discussion
afterwards); and thus, the sample mean or distribution can be undeﬁned or completely
arbitrary.
3
So a natural question is: besides constructing a few examples or counterexamples in an
ad hoc way, can one study a continuum of independent random variables (or stochastic
processes) in a meaningful way at all? An essential difﬁculty is that independence and joint
measurability with respect to the usual measure-theoretic product are never compatible with
each other except for some trivial cases.
4 Thus, one needs to work with an enrichment of
the usual measure-theoretic product for the study of processes with independent random
variables. As demonstrated in [31–34], the Loeb product probability spaces do provide
such a framework. Several versions of the exact law of large numbers as well as some new
properties of independence are proven in [32,33].
In this paper, a Fubini extension is formally introduced as a probability space that extends
the usual product probability space and retains the Fubini property.
5 An advantage of this
approach is that one can apply simple measure-theoretic methods directly in this frame-
work to obtain some useful versions of the exact law of large numbers and their converses
without going through some details in nonstandard models as in [32]. Large economies
with individual risks can also be studied easily in this framework. Note that the Fubini-type
property that allows changing the order of iterated integrals is an idealization of changing
the order of summation signs in the discrete setting. It should be a minimal requirement for
working with a continuum of random variables whenever possible.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the analytic framework
of a Fubini extension is introduced and its applications are developed systematically. In
1 See, for example,[9,28] and references in[12,32,34].
2 In the case of a continuum of i.i.d. stochastic processes with a Lebesgue measurable index space, it is assumed
that almost all empirical processes have common ﬁnite-dimensional distributions.
3 See also [10,19].
4 See [11, p. 67], and Proposition2.1 below.
5 This idea, which is extracted from the relevant properties of Loeb product spaces, also shows why Loeb
product spaces work well for studying the problems. For details on Loeb (product) spaces, see[3,26,27].

particular, we obtain various versions of the exact law of large numbers and their converses
for a continuum of random variables or stochastic processes in this framework by applying
some simple measure-theoretic methods. These versions of the exact law of large numbers
and their converses are perhaps all that one needs for applications in economics; and thus we
give complete proofs. Such kind of results were shown earlier in[32] in the particular case
of Loeb product spaces.
6 The Loeb product framework naturally allows the Fubini property
for functions of several variables which are not necessarily measurable with respect to the
usual product /afii9846-algebras while the Fubini property for the Fubini extension introduced
in this paper is only stated for functions of two variables. The Fubini property for some
functions of three variables in the framework of a Fubini extension has to be specially
proven in Lemmas 2.3 and A.1 below; and the proofs for several versions of the exact law
of large numbers and their converses in [32] have to be adapted to the new framework.
Malinvaud [29] considered individual risks in the context of Pareto-optimal allocations
for a sequence of ﬁnite markets with given ﬁnitely many types and each type havingN agents
with convex, continuous and complete preorderings.
7 A full system of insurance that allows
net transfers across states by individual agents was introduced to allocate individual risks.
Some versions of the classical law of large numbers were used to claim that the budget of
the insurance system would be approximately balanced in the absence of transaction costs
when N goes to inﬁnity.
As a simple application of the analytic framework of a Fubini extension developed in
Section 2, a model for a large economy with individual risks is presented in Section 3.
8 The
model presented here goes beyond the one in [29] in several aspects. First, the restriction
of ﬁxed types with the same number of agents in each type (i.e., only a replica economy
was considered in [29]) is removed. Second, the convexity of individual preferences is not
assumed. Third, it is shown that the risks are insurable if and only if they are essentially
pairwise independent.
9 We work not only with Pareto optimality but also with pseudo-
equilibrium and equilibrium.
Theorem 4.2 in Section 4 shows the following. Once a Fubini extension is adopted, one
can prove that almost all sample functions in an essentially pairwise independent process
cannot be essentially measurable with respect to any countably generated sub-/afii9846-algebra of
the /afii9846-algebra on the index space. Thus, it can be proved that almost no sample functions
are Lebesgue measurable. This is in contrast with the indeterminacy of the size of Lebesgue
6 Theorems 2.6, 2.8, 2.12, 2.16, and 2.17 in this paper correspond, respectively, to (part of) Theorems 4.6, 7.6,
7.16, 8.2 and 8.12 in[32].
7 Here is Footnote 7 in[29]: “Since we are dealing here with large economies we could dispense with convexity
assumptions. But the argument would have to be more laborious; the complication does not seem advisable here.”
8 Malinvaud held the expectation that the idea of allocating individual risks in large markets could be better
developed in the context of economies with a continuum of agents. He wrote[29, p. 313] that “Economists of
the Aumann–Debreu school will soon make this paper obsolete when they turn heir powerful machinery in the
direction that I am exploring.” This expectation has not been realized earlier due to problems with a continuum of
independent random variables.
9 Malinvaud attempted to introduce some dependence among agents. Our characterization of insurable risks
shows that the condition of essential pairwise independence is the optimal condition for an insurance system to
work.

measurable samples in the setting of the usual continuum product based on the Kolmogorov
construction. 10
Section 5 concerns with the existence of measurable processes with essentially pairwise
independent random variables in a Fubini extension. We analyze the problem through the
concept of a rich product probability space, which is deﬁned to be a Fubini extension that
includes a measurable process with essentially i.i.d. random variables of uniform distribu-
tion. In particular, Proposition 5.3 shows that one can construct processes on a rich product
probability space with essentially pairwise independent random variables that take any
given variety of distributions. The atomless Loeb product spaces form a typical class of rich
product probability spaces. One can also extend the usual continuum product based on the
Kolmogorov construction to obtain a rich product probability space, which is not a Loeb
product space itself. This also means that the results presented in Section 2 here are more
general than the corresponding results presented in [32].
Section 6 discusses the literature related to the exact law of large numbers. In particular, it
is shown that the usual continuum product based on the Kolmogorov construction together
with the unit Lebesgue interval fails to be a good mathematical model for modeling indi-
vidual risks in all the three aspects with the usual continuum product as a sample space, the
unit Lebesgue interval as an index space, and their product as a joint agent-sample space.
The purely ﬁnitely additive measure-theoretic framework is also shown to be not suitable
for modeling individual risks in the sense that arbitrary claims can be made and the exact
law of large numbers can fail completely in terms of sample distributions.
The proofs of some results in Sections 2–5 are given in Appendix A. We note that standard
measure-theoretic methods are used at all places except in the proof of Proposition 5.6 in
Appendix A.4 where some nonstandard analysis is used for the proof of existence.
Before moving to the main body of the paper, we give some comments on modeling the
agent space of a large economy. It is well-known that for the purpose of modeling the name
space of many economic agents, what one needs is simply an atomless (countably additive)
measure space, and no particular topological structure on the name space is relevant at all
(see [17]). In the literature, a continuum population often simply means an atomless measure
space of agents. Though the concrete case of the unit Lebesgue interval is also often used as
the space of agents [5], only the atomlessness property of the Lebesgue measure is relevant.
As shown in Proposition 5.6 below, the agent name spaceI in our analytic framework can
still be taken to be the unit interval[0, 1] with some atomless probability measure/afii9838on a
/afii9846-algebra I if one prefers to think in terms of[0, 1].
11 However, Corollary 4.3 below shows
that it would be meaningless to takeI as the Lebesgue /afii9846-algebra and /afii9838as the Lebesgue
measure to index a continuum of independent random variables. On the other hand, if one
would like to translate exact results based on an atomless measure space to some large ﬁnite
results, one needs to work with a hyperﬁnite Loeb space, which is shown in [25] to have
many other advantages over the unit Lebesgue interval.
10 The sample size is shown to have inner and outer measures 0 and 1, respectively, and thus can be assigned
any value in[0, 1] in an extension; see[19] and the discussion after Proposition6.1 in Section 6 below.
11 This means that when one considers a process indexed byI , one does work with a continuum of random
variables literally.

2. Exact law of large numbers and its converse
In this section, we obtain various versions of the exact law of large numbers and their
converses for a continuum of random variables or stochastic processes in the framework of
a Fubini extension. The concept of a Fubini extension is formally introduced in Section2.1.
It is then shown in Section 2.2 that essential uncorrelatedness is necessary and sufﬁcient
for the sample means to be constant in some strong sense. Section 2.3 presents the exact
law of large numbers and its converse in terms of sample distributions. Section 2.4 proves
the exact law of large numbers for a continuum of stochastic processes. Some of the results
are proven in this section, and the rest of the proofs can be found in Appendix A.1.
2.1. Fubini extension
Let probability spaces (I, I, /afii9838) and (/afii9821, F,P) be our index and sample spaces, respec-
tively. Let(I × /afii9821, I ⊗ F, /afii9838⊗ P) be the usual product probability space.
12 The following
result shows that independence and joint measurability with respect to the usual measure-
theoretic product are never compatible with each other except for the trivial case that almost
all random variables are essentially constant.
13 It also means that even if one chooses a
very large /afii9846-algebra on the index space I of a nontrivial independent process so that all
the sample functions are measurable, the process itself is still not jointly measurable with
respect toI ⊗F. For a functionf on I ×/afii9821, and(i, /afii9853) ∈ I ×/afii9821, f
i represents the function
f( i ,·) on /afii9821, and f/afii9853the function f( ·, /afii9853) on I .
Proposition 2.1. Let f be a function fromI × /afii9821to a Polish space X(i.e., a topological
space that is homeomorphic to a complete separable metric space). If f is jointly measurable
on the product probability space(I × /afii9821, I ⊗ F, /afii9838⊗ P) , and for /afii9838-almost all s ∈ I , fs
is independent of fi for /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I (this condition is called essential pairwise
independence), 14 then, for /afii9838-almost alli ∈ I , fi is a constant random variable. 15
As noted in Section 1, the Fubini-type property associated with joint measurability is
simply an idealization of changing the order of summation signs in the discrete setting, and
this property should be retained as far as possible for a meaningful study of independent
processes. To resolve the incompatibility of independence and joint measurability with
respect to the usual measure-theoretic product, one can work with a probability space
12 For the deﬁnition and properties of product measures, see[30, p. 303]. Here, we also use the convention that
a probability space is always a complete, countably additive measure space.
13 This is Proposition 1 in[33]. See [11, p. 67] for the case that(I, I, /afii9838) is a Lebesgue space and the relevant
process is i.i.d.
14 If /afii9838is atomless and the process f has mutually independent random variables, then for any s ∈ I , fs is
independent of fi for any i ̸= s (and hence for /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I ). This means that the condition of essential
pairwise independence is indeed satisﬁed.
15 The result is valid even when/afii9838has atoms; let A be such an atom. One can simply observe that the essential
pairwise independence condition implies the essential constancy of the random variablesfi for /afii9838-almost alli ∈ A;
see the argument in the proof of Lemma5.2 below.

(I ×/afii9821, W,Q )that extends the usual product probability space(I ×/afii9821, I ⊗F, /afii9838⊗P) and
retains the Fubini-type property. Here is a formal deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2.2. A probability space(I ×/afii9821, W,Q )extending the usual product space(I ×
/afii9821, I ⊗ F, /afii9838⊗ P) is said to be a Fubini extension of (I × /afii9821, I ⊗ F, /afii9838⊗ P) if for any
real-valued Q-integrable function f on (I × /afii9821, W),
(1) the two functions fi and f/afii9853are integrable, respectively, on(/afii9821, F,P) for /afii9838-almost all
i ∈ I , and on(I, I, /afii9838) for P-almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9821;
(2)
∫
/afii9821fi dP and

I f/afii9853dP are integrable, respectively, on(I, I, /afii9838) and (/afii9821, F,P) , with∫

To reﬂect the fact that the probability space(I × /afii9821, W,Q )has (I, I, /afii9838) and (/afii9821, F,P)
as its marginal spaces, as required by the Fubini property, it will be denoted by (I ×
/afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) .
It will be shown in Section 5 below that there are Fubini extensions in which one can
construct measurable processes with essentially pairwise independent random variables
taking any given variety of distributions. Such measurable processes can only exist in a
strict extension of the usual product probability space, as shown in Proposition 2.1.
2.2. Uncorrelatedness and the exact law of large numbers
In the rest of this paper, we shall always work with a Fubini extension(I × /afii9821, I ⊠F,
/afii9838⊠P) . The following lemma is a generalized version of the Fubini property for a Fubini
extension.
Lemma 2.3. Let g and h be real-valued square integrable processes on a Fubini extension
(I ×/afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) . Deﬁne a real-valued function G onI ×I ×/afii9821by lettingG(s, i,/afii9853) =
g(s, /afii9853)h(i, /afii9853) for (s, i,/afii9853) ∈ I × I × /afii9821. Then
(i) Fo r/afii9838-almost alls ∈ I , /afii9838
-almost alli ∈ I , the functionG(s, i,·) on /afii9821is P-integrable.
(ii) Fo r/afii9838-almost all s ∈ I , the function
∫
/afii9821G(s, i,/afii9853)dP( /afii9853) in terms of i ∈ I is /afii9838-
integrable.

∫
/afii9821G(s, i,/afii9853)dP( /afii9853)d /afii9838(i) in terms ofs ∈ I is /afii9838-integrable.
(iv) The function
∫
I g(s, /afii9853)d /afii9838(s)
∫
I h(i, /afii9853)d /afii9838(i) in terms of/afii9853∈ /afii9821is P-integrable, and

16 The classical Fubini theorem is only stated for the usual product measure spaces. It does not apply to integrable
functions on (I × /afii9821, W,Q )since these functions may not beI ⊗ F-measurable. However, the conclusions of
that theorem do hold for processes on the enriched product space(I × /afii9821, W,Q )that extends the usual product.

Proof. (i) The Fubini property implies that for/afii9838-almost all s ∈ I , /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I , both
the functions gs (/afii9853) and hi (/afii9853) in terms of /afii9853∈ /afii9821are P-square integrable; and hence the
product G(s, i,/afii9853) = g(s, /afii9853)h(i, /afii9853) is P-integrable on /afii9821.
(ii) Any real-valued function /afii9850that is P-square integrable on /afii9821is still square inte-
grable on (I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) ; and thus the product/afii9850(/afii9853)h(i, /afii9853) is integrable on (I ×
/afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) .
For /afii9838-almost all s ∈ I , gs is P-square integrable; and hence the productgs (/afii9853)h(i, /afii9853)
is integrable on (I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) . The Fubini property implies that for/afii9838-almost all
s ∈ I , the function
∫
/afii9821G(s, i,/afii9853)dP( /afii9853) in terms ofi ∈ I is /afii9838-integrable, and also

I h(i, /afii9853)d /afii9838(i) is P-square integrable on /afii9821, the product g(s, /afii9853)
∫
I h(i, /afii9853)
d/afii9838(i) is integrable on(I ×/afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) . The Fubini property implies that the function

h(i, /afii9853)d /afii9838(i) dP (/afii9853)

The following is a formal deﬁnition of essential uncorrelatedness in the setting of a Fubini
extension.
Deﬁnition 2.4. Let f be a real-valued square integrable process on(I ×/afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) .
The random variablesfi are said to be essentially uncorrelated, if for/afii9838-almost alls ∈ I , fs
is uncorrelated withfi for /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I .
The following proposition shows that it is very simple to obtain an exact law of large
numbers in terms of sample means in the framework of a Fubini extension. In particular, it

shows that if a square integrable process is essentially uncorrelated, then its sample means
are essentially constant.
Proposition 2.5. Let f be a real-valued square integrable process on (I × /afii9821, I ⊠F,
/afii9838⊠P) . If the random variables fi are essentially uncorrelated, then for P-almost all
/afii9853∈ /afii9821, the sample meanEf/afii9853=
∫
I f/afii9853d/afii9838is the same as the mean of the processEf =∫
I ×/afii9821fd /afii9838⊠P .
Proof. Deﬁne real-valued square integrable processesg and h on (I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P)
by lettingg(i, /afii9853) = h(i, /afii9853) = f( i ,/afii9853) −Efi for any(i, /afii9853) ∈ I ×/afii9821. Then, for/afii9838-almost all
s ∈ I, /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I,
∫
/afii9821gs (/afii9853)hi (/afii9853)dP( /afii9853) = 0. Hence, Lemma2.3(iv) implies that

/afii9821

I
g(s, /afii9853)d /afii9838(s)
∫
I
h(i, /afii9853)d /afii9838(i) dP (/afii9853) =
∫
/afii9821
(Ef/afii9853− Ef )2 dP( /afii9853) = 0,
which implies Ef/afii9853= Ef for P-almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9821. □
It is argued in [4,12,13,31–34] that a stronger conclusion than that of Proposition 2.5
may often be important from an economic point of view. Namely, the sample means are

random variablesfi to be essentially uncorrelated. The implication (ii)/equal1⇒ (i) is a converse
law of large numbers.
Theorem 2.6. Let f be a real-valued square integrable process on(I ×/afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) .
Then, the following are equivalent:

restriction of /afii9838⊠P to A × /afii9821is rescaled to a probability measure. Thus (i)/equal1⇒ (ii) follows.

2.3. The exact law of large numbers in sample distributions and its converse
The following is a formal deﬁnition of essential pairwise independence in the setting of
a Fubini extension.
Deﬁnition 2.7. Let f be a process from a Fubini extension (I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) to a
Polish space X. The random variables fi are said to be essentially pairwise independent
if for /afii9838-almost all s ∈ I , the random variablesfs and fi are independent for /afii9838-almost all
i ∈ I .
The following theorem is an analog of Theorem2.6 in terms of sample distributions.
Theorem 2.8. Let f be a process from(I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) to a Polish space X. Then
the following are equivalent.
(i) The random variablesfi are essentially pairwise independent.
(ii) F or any setA ∈ I with /afii9838(A) > 0, the sample distribution/afii9838(f A
/afii9853)−1 is the same as the
distribution (/afii9838A ⊠P )(fA)−1 of the processf A for P-almost all/afii9853∈ /afii9821, where f A is the
restriction of f toA × /afii9821, IA ={ C ∈ I : C ⊆ A} and (IA ⊠F) ={ E ∈ I ⊠F : E ⊆
(A × /afii9821)}, and /afii9838A and (/afii9838A ⊠P) the probability measures rescaled respectively from
the restrictions of/afii9838to IA and (/afii9838⊠P) to (IA ⊠F).
Proof. For (i) /equal1⇒ (ii), we only consider the caseA = I for notational simplicity. Fix a
countable open base {On}∞
n=1 for X so that it is closed under ﬁnite intersections (a class
of sets is said to be closed under ﬁnite intersections if the intersections of any ﬁnitely
many sets in the class are still in the class). By the independence assumption, the random
variables (1
f −1(On))i in the process 1f −1(On) are essentially uncorrelated, where 1D denotes
the indicator function of the setD in some space. By Proposition2.5, there is aP-null set
Sn such that for any/afii9853/∈ Sn, f/afii9853is I-measurable and /afii9838(f −1
/afii9853(On)) = (/afii9838⊠P )(f−1(On)).
Let S be the union of all theSn. Then S is still aP-null set.
For each/afii9853∈ /afii9821, let/afii9839/afii9853be the distribution of the sample functionf/afii9853(which exists almost
surely by the Fubini property). The distribution off as a random variable is denoted by/afii9839.
Then, for any/afii9853/∈ S,
/afii9839/afii9853(On) = /afii9838(f −1
/afii9853(On)) = (/afii9838⊠P )(f−1(On)) = /afii9839(On)
for all n⩾1. Since the class of all theOn generates the Borel algebra, and is also closed
under ﬁnite intersections, i.e., a/afii9843-system, it follows from the result on the uniqueness of
measures (see [8, p. 45]) that/afii9839/afii9853= /afii9839for any /afii9853/∈ S.
Next, we consider (ii)/equal1⇒ (i). Fixm, n⩾1. As in the proof of Theorem 2.6, letA, B∈ I,
and takeg = 1A(1Om (f )−E1Om (fi )) and h = 1B (1On (f )−E1On (fi )) in Lemma 2.3(iv).

(ii) implies that the right-hand side of Eq. (4) is zero. By the arbitrary choice ofA and
B, the same proof as in Theorem 2.6 can be used to claim that for/afii9838-almost all s ∈ I , gs is
orthogonal to hi for /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I . This means that for/afii9838-almost all s ∈ I , /afii9838-almost all
i ∈ I ,

∫
/afii9821
(1Om (f ))s dP

(1On (f ))i dP. (5)
Thus, there is a subsetN of I ×I such that Eq. (5) holds for all(s, i) /∈ N , and for/afii9838-almost
all s ∈ I , the set Ns ={ I ∈ I : (s, i) ∈ N } is a /afii9838-null set. By grouping countably many
such sets together, there exists a subsetN ′ of I × I such that for/afii9838-almost all s ∈ I , the set
N ′
s ={ I ∈ I : (s, i)∈ N ′} is a /afii9838-null set, and
P( f−1
s (Om) ∩ f −1
i (On)) = P( f−1
s (Om)) · P( f−1
i (On))
holds for all(s, i) /∈ N ′, and for allm, n⩾1. Thus, for each(s, i) /∈ N ′, the joint distribution
P( fs ,f i )−1 agrees with the product of its marginals on a/afii9843-system {Om × On : m, n⩾1}
for X ×X. Hence,P( fs ,f i )−1 = Pf −1
s ⊗Pf −1
i by a result on the uniqueness of measures
(see [8, p. 45]). This means thatfs and fi are independent for all(s, i) /∈ N ′. □
The following obvious corollary is an exact law of large numbers for a continuum of
random variables in the setting of sample distributions (i.e., an exact version of the classical
Glivenko–Cantelli theorem).
Corollary 2.9. Let f be a process from (I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) to a Polish space X. If
the random variablesf
i are essentially pairwise independent, then the sample distribution
/afii9838f −1
/afii9853is the same as the distribution(/afii9838⊠P) f−1 for P-almost all/afii9853∈ /afii9821.
In Proposition 2.5, the process f is assumed to be square integrable. However, if the
real-valued random variables fi are essentially pairwise independent, we only need to
assume integrability forf in order to obtain the same conclusion. The following corollary
follows immediately from Corollary 2.9 by the fact thatEf/afii9853=
∫
R xd /afii9838f −1
/afii9853and Ef =∫
R xd (/afii9838⊠P) f−1.
Corollary 2.10. Let f be a real-valued integrable process on(I ×/afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) . If the
random variables fi are essentially pairwise independent, then the sample meanEf/afii9853=

∫
I f/afii9853d/afii9838is the same as the meanEf =
∫
I ×/afii9821fd /afii9838⊠P of the process f for P-almost all
/afii9853∈ /afii9821.
The following corollary generalizes Corollaries2.9 and 2.10 to the setting of conditional
independence on a ﬁnite sub-/afii9846-algebra of F. It can be proved by applying Corollaries 2.9
and 2.10 to the processes restricted toI × Ck for some measurable subsetsCk of /afii9821.
Corollary 2.11. Let f be a process from(I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) to a Polish space X, and
C a /afii9846-algebra generated by aF-measurable partition {C1,...,C n} of /afii9821with P( Ck)> 0
for 1 ⩽k ⩽n. Assume that the random variablesfi are essentially pairwise independent
conditioned on C, i.e., for each 1 ⩽k ⩽n, the restriction f Ck o fft o I × Ck i sap r o -
cess with essentially pairwise independent random variablesf Ck
i on the probability space
(Ck, FCk ,P Ck ), where FCk ={ D ∈ F : D ⊆ Ck}, and P Ck is the probability measure
rescaled from the restriction of P toFCk . Then the following results hold.
(1) The sample distribution/afii9838f −1
/afii9853is essentiallyC-measurable with/afii9838f −1
/afii9853(B) = (/afii9838⊠P Ck )
(f Ck )−1 for P-almost all/afii9853∈ Ck, where (/afii9838⊠P Ck ) is the probability measure rescaled
from the restriction of(/afii9838⊠P) to (I ⊠FCk ) ={ E ∈ I ⊠F : E ⊆ (I × Ck)}.
(2) When f is a real-valued/afii9838⊠P -integrable process, the sample meanEf/afii9853is the average

P( Ck )
∫
I ×Ck fd /afii9838⊠P o ffo nI × Ck for P-almost all/afii9853∈ Ck.
The following is a duality result for the random variables and sample functions in a
process, which will be used to prove Proposition5.5 below.
Theorem 2.12. Let f be a process from(I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) to a Polish space X. Then
the following are equivalent.
(i) The random variables fi are essentially pairwise independent; and the fi ’s have a
common distribution/afii9839for /afii9838-almost alli ∈ I .
(ii) The sample functions f/afii9853are essentially pairwise independent; and the f/afii9853’s have a
common distribution/afii9839for P-almost all/afii9853∈ /afii9821.
2.4. The exact law of large numbers for a continuum of stochastic processes
Let T be a set of time parameters, which is assumed to be the set ofZ+ of positive integers
or an interval (starting from 0) in the setR+ of nonnegative real numbers. LetBT be the
power set ofT when T is the countable setZ+, and the Borel/afii9846-algebra on T when T is an
interval.
Let F be a real-valued measurable function on the mixed product measurable space
((I × /afii9821) × T,( I ⊠F) ⊗ BT ), which is the usual product of the measurable space(I ×
/afii9821, I ⊠F) in the Fubini extension with(T ,BT ). For any i ∈ I , let Fi be the function on
/afii9821× T with Fi (/afii9853,t) = F( i ,/afii9853,t) ; and for any /afii9853∈ /afii9821, let F/afii9853be the function on I × T
with F/afii9853(i, t) = F( i ,/afii9853,t) . Lemma 2.13 below says that bothFi and F/afii9853are measurable
stochastic processes. Thus,F can be viewed as a family of stochastic processes,Fi ,i ∈ I ,
with a sample space(/afii9821, F,P) and a time parameter spaceT.F o r/afii9853∈ /afii9821, F/afii9853is called an
empirical process with the index space(I, I, /afii9838) as the sample space. The functionF itself


--- PAGE 12 ---

42 Y.N. Sun / Journal of Economic Theory 126 (2006) 31 – 69
can also be viewed as a stochastic process with sample spaceI × /afii9821and time parameter
space T.
Lemma 2.13. Let F be a real-valued measurable function on the mixed product measurable
space ((I × /afii9821) × T,( I ⊠F) ⊗ BT ). Then, Fi is F⊗BT -measurable for/afii9838-almost alli ∈ I ;
and F/afii9853is I ⊗ BT -measurable for P-almost all/afii9853∈ /afii9821.
The following are the formal deﬁnitions on the independence and ﬁnite-dimensional
distributions of stochastic processes.
Deﬁnition 2.14. (1) Two real-valued stochastic processes /afii9850and /afii9852on the same sample
space with time parameter spaceT are said to be independent, if, for any positive integers
m, n, and for any t1
1 ,...,t 1
m in T, and t2
1 ,...,t 2
n in T, the random vectors (/afii9850t1
1
,..., /afii9850t1m )
and (/afii9852t2
1
,..., /afii9852t2n ) are independent.
(2) We say that the stochastic processes{Fi ,i ∈ I } are essentially pairwise independent,
if, for /afii9838-almost all s ∈ I , /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I , the stochastic processes Fs and Fi are
independent.
Deﬁnition 2.15. (1) Two real-valued stochastic processes/afii9850and /afii9852on some (possibly differ-
ent) sample spaces with time parameter spaceT are said to have the same ﬁnite-dimensional
distributions, if, for anyt1,...,t n ∈ T , the random vectors(/afii9850t1 ,..., /afii9850tn ) and (/afii9852t1 ,..., /afii9852tn )
have the same distribution.
(2) We say that the stochastic processes {Fi ,i ∈ I } have essentially the same ﬁnite-
dimensional distributions if there is a real-valued stochastic processG with time parameter
space T such that for /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I , the stochastic processesFi and G have the same
ﬁnite-dimensional distributions.
When the time–space T is discrete, a real-valued discrete parameter stochastic process
can be viewed as a random variable taking values inR∞. Thus, Corollary2.9 can be used to
obtain an exact law of large numbers for a continuum of discrete time processes. Similarly,
for the case thatT is an interval and for a stochastic process whose paths come from some
function space with a complete separable metric (for example, the continuous function
space onT or the Skorokhod space as in [6]), it can be regarded as a random variable in the
function space. Corollary 2.9 can be applied again.
To consider more general continuous time processes, one may need a technique used
in [18] that relates a continuous time process to a discrete time process. In particular, it is
shown that for a continuous time processx on (/afii9806×T, A ⊗B
T ) with a probability measure
/afii9840on (/afii9806, A), there exists a sequence{tn}∞
n=1 in T and a Borel function/afii9852: R∞ × T → R,
such that for any t ∈ T , x(q,t) = /afii9852({x(q,t n)}∞
n=1,t) for /afii9840-almost all q ∈ /afii9806. 19 Let
ˆx(q,t) = /afii9852({x(q,t n)}∞
n=1,t) for all q ∈ /afii9806and t ∈ T . It is clear thatˆx is a versionx (i.e.,
for each t, xt =ˆxt almost surely) and for/afii9840-almost all q ∈ /afii9806, ˆx(q,t) = /afii9852({ˆx(q,t n)}∞
n=1,t)
for all t ∈ T . Such an ˆx is called a regular version of x, and ˆx is a regular version of
19 See [18, p. 172]and [22]; denote the composition/p10◦ /afii9852there simply by/afii9852. The proof in[18], which is stated
for T = R+, works for the case thatT is a general interval.

itself. In probability theory, one can always work with a version of a stochastic process with
some more regularity without changing the probabilistic meanings. For simplicity, we shall
assume that F is a regular version of itself when it is viewed as a stochastic process with
sample space/afii9806= I ×/afii9821, i.e., there exists a sequence{t
n}∞
n=1 in T such that for/afii9838⊠P -almost
all (i, /afii9853) ∈ I × /afii9821, F( i ,/afii9853,t) = /afii9852({F( i ,/afii9853,t n)}∞
n=1,t) for all t ∈ T . 20
We shall now present an exact law of large numbers for a continuum of stochastic
processes. 21
Theorem 2.16. Let F be a real-valued measurable function on the mixed product measur-
able space((I × /afii9821) × T,( I ⊠F) ⊗ BT ). Assume that F is a regular version of itself when
it is viewed as a stochastic process with sample spaceI × /afii9821. If the stochastic processes
Fi are essentially pairwise independent, then, for P-almost all/afii9853∈ /afii9821, the empirical pro-
cess F/afii9853on I × T and F viewed as a stochastic process have the same ﬁnite-dimensional
distributions.
The following is an analog of Theorem2.12 in the setting of a continuum of stochastic
processes.
Theorem 2.17. Let F be a real-valued measurable function on the mixed product mea-
surable space ((I × /afii9821) × T,( I ⊠F) ⊗ BT ). Assume that F is a regular version of itself
when it is viewed as a stochastic process with sample spaceI ×/afii9821. The stochastic processes
Fi are essentially pairwise independent and have essentially the same ﬁnite-dimensional
distributions as a ﬁxed stochastic process H with a sample space(/afii9806, A, /afii9840) if and only if the
empirical processesF/afii9853satisfy the same properties.
In particular, if H is a Markov process, then almost all empirical processesF/afii9853behave
exactly likeH since a Markov process is completely characterized by its ﬁnite-dimensional
distributions (see, for example, [18, p. 163]). Thus, if a continuum of physical or social
entities move independently of each other and each of them can be described by a Brownian
motion, then the observable empirical process is also exactly governed by a Brownian motion
process (see [32, p. 491] for a detailed discussion).
3. Pareto optimality, equilibrium and characterization of insurable risks
This section develops a model for a large economy with individual risks based on a
Fubini extension. While a replica economy with convex preferences was considered in [29],
our model in Section 3.1 is a general economy with possibly nonconvex preferences.
22
While [29] used the second welfare theorem to support a Pareto-optimal equilibrium by
20 This is trivially satisﬁed whenT = Z+; taketn = n for anyn ⩾1, and/afii9852({zn}∞
n=1,t) = zt for any{zn}∞
n=1 ∈
R∞,t ∈ Z+. It also holds automatically for the stochastic processF when its sample pathsFi/afii9853are right continuous
with left limits/afii9838⊠P -almost surely.
21 Similar to Theorem2.8, a converse to the result in Theorem2.16 can also be proven.
22 Sun [34] considered the exact law of large numbers for a continuum of correspondences and economies with
random preferences.

a sure price, we work out the detailed relationship between Pareto optimality, pseudo-
equilibrium and equilibrium for the original economy and an averaged economy in Section
3.2. A complete insurance system was introduced in [29] and its asymptotic viability is
shown under the assumption of independent (or approximately independent) agents. The
primary contribution of Section 3.3 is to show that essentially pairwise independent risks
are insurable; and more surprisingly, only the essentially pairwise independent risks are
insurable. The proofs of all the results in this section except for Theorem 3.10 are given in
Appendix A.2.
3.1. The economic model
Let (I, I, /afii9838) be an atomless measure space of agents with/afii9838(I )= 1, (/afii9821, F,P) a sample
probability space modeling all the uncertainty in the economy, and(I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P)
a Fubini extension.
Let S ={ 1, 2,...,h } be a ﬁnite set of states that all the agents are possibly in. For an
individual agent i, she may ﬁnd herself in some of these states, not necessarily in all of
them. Let f be a measurable mapping from(I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) to S; f( i ,/afii9853) gives the
particular state that agenti may ﬁnd herself in for a particular realization of/afii9853.
We shall denote the probability of agenti being in state s, P (f
−1
i ({s})) by /afii9843i (s). The
Fubini property implies that for each s ∈ S, /afii9843i (s) is I-measurable on I . Let Si ={ s ∈
S : /afii9843i (s) > 0} with ni the number of elements in Si . These are the only states that are
relevant to agent i. Note that Si is a nonempty subset of the ﬁnite set S for each i ∈ I .
We can thus ﬁnd a measurable partition {I 1,...,I K } of I such that for each 1⩽k ⩽K,
the agents i in I k have the sameSi , which is denoted bySk. Without loss of generality, we
assume that theK sets S1,...,S K are different from each other and/afii9838(I k)> 0 for eachk.
For simplicity, we shall work with a pure exchange economy withm commodities for
consumption. For an agenti ∈ I , xs ∈ Rm
+ denotes her consumption in states ∈ Si . Thus
the consumption space for agenti is (Rm
+)Si , which is a product space of dimensionm · ni .
For each i ∈ I and a consumption planx ∈ (Rm
+)Si , let Ei x be the expected consumption∑
s∈Si /afii9843i (s)x(s) . When i ∈ I k, (Rm
+)Si is simply (Rm
+)Sk
.
For each 1⩽k ⩽K, letPk be the space of complete continuous preorderings⪯ , i.e., reﬂex-
ive, transitive and complete binary relations on(Rm
+)Sk
whose graphs are closed subsets of
(Rm
+)Sk
× (Rm
+)Sk
. The space Pk is endowed with the topology of closed
convergence. 23
A preference-endowment mapping/afii9825= (/afii9825p, /afii9825e) is a mapping from the space of economic
agents (I, I, /afii9838) to the space of preference-endowment pairs∪K
k=1 Pk × (Rm
+)Sk
such that
(1) the restriction /afii9825|I k of /afii9825to I k is a measurable mapping from I k to Pk × (Rm
+)Sk
; (2)
for eachi ∈ I k, /afii9825p(i) is the preference relation of agenti, which is an element ofPk and also
23 See [17, p. 86]for the deﬁnition of a preference relation, p. 19 and 96 for the topology of closed convergence
on preference relations. Proposition 4 in [14] showed that Pk is a G/afii9829-set in the compact metric space of all
preferences, and thus a Polish space in itself.

denoted by ⪯ i ; (3) for eachi ∈ I k, /afii9825e(i) is the initial endowment of agenti, which is an
element of (Rm
+)Sk
and also denoted byei or e(i); (4)
∫
I k e(i) d/afii9838is ﬁnite. We shall denote
the economy summarized as[(I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) ,f ,(/afii9825p, /afii9825e)] by E. A (deterministic)
price system p for the economyE is a nonzero vector inRm.
An allocation /p10for the economy E is a mapping from (I, I, /afii9838) to ∪K
k=1 (Rm
+)Sk
such
that the restriction /p10|I k of /p10to I k is an integrable function fromI k to (Rm
+)Sk
. For each
i ∈ I , /p10(i) (or /p10i ) is the consumption plan of agenti, and /p10i (s) her consumption at state
s. It is clear that the expected consumptionEi /p10(i) deﬁnes an integrable function onI .A n
allocation /p10is said to befeasible if it has the same average expected consumption as the
allocation deﬁned by the initial endowments, i.e.,
∫
I Ei /p10(i) d/afii9838(i) =
∫
I Ei e(i) d/afii9838(i), which
also means statewise feasibility under the assumption of essential pairwise independence
on f (see Footnote 24).
Deﬁnition 3.1. Let /p10be a feasible allocation for the economyE.
(1) /p10is Pareto optimal if there does not exist any other feasible allocation /afii9852such that
/p10
i ⪯ i /afii9852i for /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I , and /afii9838({i ∈ I : /p10i ≺i /afii9852i })> 0.
(2) /p10is a pseudo-equilibrium if there is a price systemp such that for/afii9838-almost all i ∈ I ,
/p10(i) is a minimizer for expected expenditure in the sense that for any z ∈ (Rm
+)Si ,
/p10(i) ⪯ i z implies p · Ei /p10(i) ⩽p · Ei z.
(3) /p10is an equilibrium if there is a price systemp such that for/afii9838-almost all i ∈ I , /p10(i) is
a maximal element in the expected budget set{z ∈ (Rm
+)Si : p · Ei z⩽p · Ei /p10(i)}, i.e.,
for any z ∈ (Rm
+)Si , p · Ei z⩽p · Ei /p10(i) implies z ⪯ i /p10(i).
Corresponding to the economyE, we shall now consider an averaged nonrandom econ-
omy ¯E as in [29]. Let the initial endowment ¯e(i) of agent i in the averaged economy ¯E
be Ei e(i). It is clear that
∫
I ¯e(i) d/afii9838is ﬁnite. We shall now deﬁne a preference relation for
each agent i in the economy ¯E. Take any 1⩽k ⩽K, and let i ∈ I k be a ﬁxed agent. Then
Ei deﬁnes a mapping from (Rm
+)Sk
to Rm
+. For any given a ∈ Rm
+, the set E−1
i ({a}) =
{z ∈ (Rm
+)Sk
: Ei z = a} is compact since Sk = Si ={ s ∈ S : /afii9843i (s) > 0}. Since ⪯ i is a
continuous preordering, maximal elements exist onE−1
i ({a}) under ⪯ i ; let /afii9820k(i, a)be the
set of all such maximal elements. For simplicity, we may often drop the subscriptk when
there is no confusion. Deﬁne a binary relation ⪯ −
i on Rm
+ such that for any a, b ∈ Rm
+,
a ⪯ −
i b if and only ifxa ⪯ i xb, where xa ∈ /afii9820k(i, a)and xb ∈ /afii9820k(i, b).
Lemma 3.2. (1) The binary relation⪯ −
i is a well-deﬁned, continuous and complete pre-
ordering.
(2) F or anyI-measurable mappingsa(·) and b(·) from I toRm
+, the set{i ∈ I : a(i) ⪯ −
i
b(i)} is measurable.
For any I-measurable mapping a(·) from I to Rm
+, the proof of Lemma 3.2 in the
Appendix A also shows that/afii9820k(i, a(i))deﬁnes a measurable correspondence/afii9818k
a(·) with a
measurable selection/p10k
a(·) on I k. For simplicity, we shall often use/afii9818a(i) and /p10a(i) instead
of /afii9818k
a(i) and /p10k
a(i).

3.2. Pareto optimality and equilibrium
The following lemma shows that the individual consumption xi in an equilibrium or
Pareto-optimal allocation in the economyE is optimal inE−1
i ({Ei xi }). This kind of condi-
tion is used in (2) of Propositions3.4–3.6.
Lemma 3.3. Let x be an equilibrium or Pareto-optimal allocation in the economyE and
a(i) = Ei x, i ∈ I . Then, for /afii9838-almost alli ∈ I , xi ∈ /afii9818a(i).
In the next three propositions, we relate Pareto optimality, pseudo-equilibrium and equi-
librium in the economyE to those in the averaged economy¯E.
Proposition 3.4. Let x be a feasible allocation in the economyE, and a(i) = Ei xi . Then
the following are equivalent.
(1) x is Pareto optimal in the economyE.
(2) The allocation a is Pareto optimal in the economy ¯E; and for /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I ,
xi ∈ /afii9818a(i).
Proposition 3.5. (1) Let (x, p) be a pseudo-equilibrium in the economyE, and a(i) =
Ei xi . Then (a, p)is a pseudo-equilibrium in the economy¯E.
(2) Let (b, p) be a pseudo-equilibrium in the economy ¯E and y a feasible allocation
in E such that for /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I , yi ∈ /afii9818b(i). Then (y, p) is a pseudo-equilibrium
in E.
Proposition 3.6. (1) Let (x, p)be an equilibrium in the economyE, and a(i) = Ei xi . Then
(a, p)is an equilibrium in the economy¯E.
(2) Let (b, p)be an equilibrium in the economy¯E and y a feasible allocation inE such
that yi ∈ /afii9818b(i) for i ∈ I . Then (y, p)is an equilibrium in the economyE.
It is easy to see that if⪯ i is monotonic (i.e.,y ≺i z if y,z ∈ (Rm
+)Si with y ⩽z and y ̸= z),
so is ⪯ −
i . Since the economy ¯E is a usual measure-theoretic economy without uncertainty,
the following type of results are standard in the literature; see[16,17].
Proposition 3.7. Assume that the preference⪯ i is monotonic for each agenti ∈ I and∫
I Ei ei d/afii9838strictly positive. Let a be a feasible allocation in the economy ¯E. Then the
following are equivalent.
(1) The allocation a is Pareto optimal.
(2) There is a strictly positive price p such that(a, p)is a pseudo-equilibrium in¯E.
(3) There is a strictly positive price p such that(a, p)is an equilibrium in¯E.
By Propositions 3.4–3.7, the following corollary is obvious.
Corollary 3.8. Assume that the preference ⪯ i is monotonic for each agent i ∈ I and∫
I Ei ei d/afii9838strictly positive. Let x be a feasible allocation in the economy E. Then the


--- PAGE 17 ---

Y.N. Sun / Journal of Economic Theory 126 (2006) 31 – 69 47
following are equivalent:
(1) The allocation x is Pareto optimal.
(2) There is a strictly positive price p such that(x, p)is a pseudo-equilibrium inE.
(3) There is a strictly positive price p such that(x, p)is an equilibrium inE.
3.3. The insurance system
In this subsection, we consider an insurance system that allows free transfers between
states by economic agents as in[29]. For agenti, vi : Si −→ R is a net transfer if its expected
value ∑
s∈Si /afii9843i (s)vi (s) is zero.
Under the assumptions of Corollary 3.8, a feasible allocationx is Pareto optimal if and
only if there exists a strictly positive price systemp such that (x, p)is an equilibrium inE.
The consumption plan of agenti can be viewed as a mappingxi (fi (·)) on /afii9821. Then Ei xi is
simply the expectation ofxi (fi (·)) on /afii9821. Thus, almost every agent maximizes her preference
within her expected budget in an equilibrium. Only one budget condition is needed here.
On the other hand, if we take any two net transfersv
1
i and v2
i for agenti, and anyz ∈ (Rm
+)Si
that satisﬁes the budget conditions for the individual states in the form
pz(s) + v2
i (s) ⩽pxi (s) + v1
i (s) for s ∈ Si ,
then we still havez ⪯ i xi . That is, no matter what kind of net transfers an agent chooses, if
budget conditions are satisﬁed for individual states, then the originalxi is still optimal.
Next, we consider the behavior of individual agents in an equilibrium. Suppose that her
real income at states is Ri (s). She will ﬁrst choosexi such that it is the maximal element
within her expected budget. Then she will choose some net transfersvi (s) such that her
expenditure pxi (s) does not exceed her resourcesRi (s) + vi (s) in each states. In fact, one
can take
vi (s) = pxi (s) − Ri (s) +
∑
s∈Si
/afii9843i (s)Ri (s) − pEi xi .
It is clear that ∑
s∈Si /afii9843i (s)vi (s) = 0. Since ∑
s∈Si /afii9843i (s)Ri (s) − pEi xi ⩾0, we have
vi (s) ⩾pxi (s) − Ri (s), which is to say pxi (s) ⩽Ri (s) + vi (s) for all s ∈ Si . Thus, the
consumption xi (s) of agent i at state s is within her budgetRi (s) + vi (s) at state s.
For an agent i, her net transfers vi are deﬁned on Si . One can simply deﬁne vi on the
whole S by lettingvi (s) = 0 fors/∈ Si . The net transfersvi ,i ∈ I are said to be measurable
if for eachs ∈ S, vi (s) is I-measurable on I .
Note that for each agenti, the transfer vi (fi (/afii9853)) satisﬁes
∫
/afii9853∈/afii9821vi (fi (/afii9853)) dP = 0. For
measurable net transfersvi ,i ∈ I , and for a sample realization/afii9853, the transfer for agenti is
vi (fi (/afii9853)); and the average transfer for the society is
∫
i∈I vi (f/afii9853(i)) d/afii9838(i).
Deﬁnition 3.9. The risksfi ,i ∈ I are said to be insurable if for any measurable net transfers
vi ,i ∈ I ,
∫
i∈I
vi (f/afii9853(i)) d/afii9838(i) = 0 forP -almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9821,

which means that the budget of the whole insurance system is “exactly balanced” almost
surely.
Theorem 3.10. The risksfi ,i ∈ I are insurable if and only if they are essentially pairwise
independent.
Proof. Deﬁne a processg from I ×/afii9821to R by lettingg(i, /afii9853) = vi (f (i,/afii9853)). Then,g is still
I ⊠F-measurable; and Egi = 0 for /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I .I ft h efi ’s are essentially pairwise
independent, thegi ’s must be essentially uncorrelated. Thus, the exact law of large numbers
in Proposition 2.5 implies that
∫
i∈I
vi (f/afii9853(i)) d/afii9838=
∫
i∈I
g/afii9853(i) d/afii9838= 0
for P-almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9821. 24 This means that the risksfi ,i ∈ I are insurable.
On the other hand, assume that the risksfi ,i ∈ I are insurable. Take anyA ∈ I with
/afii9838(A) >0. Take anys0 ∈ S. Deﬁne measurable net transfersvs0
i ,i ∈ I by letting
vs0
i (s) = 1A(i) ·
(
1{s0}(s) − /afii9843i (s0)
)
,
where 1A and 1{s0} are the indicator functions of the setsA and {s0}. Since the risksfi ,i ∈ I
are insurable, we have
∫
i∈I
vs0
i (f/afii9853(i)) d/afii9838(i) =
∫
A
(
1{s0}(f/afii9853(i)) − /afii9843i (s0)
)
d/afii9838(i) = 0
for P-almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9821. Let f A, /afii9838A and /afii9838A ⊠P have the same meanings as in Theorem
2.8. Hence, for P-almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9821, (/afii9838A)(f A
/afii9853)−1({s0}) = (/afii9838A ⊠P )(fA)−1({s0}), which
means that(/afii9838A)(f A
/afii9853)−1 = (/afii9838A ⊠P )(fA)−1 by the arbitrary choice ofs0. By Theorem 2.8,
we know that thefi ’s are essentially pairwise independent. □
4. Sample measurability in a countably generated/afii9846-algebra
Deﬁnition 4.1. (1) A /afii9846-algebra C is said to be countably generated if it is generated by a
countable collection of sets (see[8, p. 110]).
(2) Let C be a countably generated sub-/afii9846-algebra of I. A measurable function/afii9825on the
index space (I, I, /afii9838) is said to be essentiallyC-measurable if there is another measurable
function /afii9826on (I, I, /afii9838) such that /afii9826(i) = /afii9825(i) for /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I and /afii9826is C-measurable.
The following theorem shows that for a nontrivial process with essentially pairwise
independent random variables, almost no sample functions are essentially measurable
24 An allocation /p10can also be viewed as a processg/p10from I × /afii9821to Rm
+ with g/p10(i, /afii9853) = /p10i (f (i,/afii9853)). Thus,
ge can be viewed as the endowment process. When the fi ’s are essentially pairwise independent, so are g/p10
i ’s
(and ge
i ’s). By the exact law of large numbers in Corollary 2.10, the feasibility condition in terms of average
expected consumption as in Section3.1 actually also means statewise feasibility in terms of
∫
I g/p10
/afii9853d/afii9838=
∫
I ge
/afii9853d/afii9838
for P -almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9821.

with respect to any ﬁxed countably generated sub-/afii9846-algebra of I. The proof is given in
Appendix A.3.
Theorem 4.2. Let f be a process from(I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) to a Polish space X, and C
any ﬁxed countably generated sub-/afii9846-algebra ofI. If the random variablesfi are essentially
pairwise independent, then the set of all/afii9853∈ /afii9821such that the sample functionf/afii9853is essentially
C-measurable must have probability zero except for the trivial case that almost all the
random variablesfi are constant.
Note that the Borel/afii9846-algebra on the unit interval[0, 1] is generated by the rational sub-
intervals and thus countably generated. It is also well-known that a Lebesgue measurable
function is essentially Borel measurable. Hence, when the index spaceI is taken to be[0, 1],
almost all sample functions of a process with essentially pairwise independent random
variables cannot be Lebesgue measurable as stated in the following obvious corollary of
Theorem 4.2.
25
Corollary 4.3. Let f be a process from(I ×/afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) to a Polish space X. Assume
that the random variablesfi are essentially pairwise independent and not essentially con-
stant. IfI =[ 0, 1], and (I, I, /afii9838) extends the Lebesgue interval([0, 1], L, /afii9840), then the set of
those sample points/afii9853whose corresponding sample functionsf/afii9853are Lebesgue measurable
must have probability zero.
Intuitively, the sample functions of a continuum of nontrivial independent random vari-
ables should be highly discontinuous. Since Lusin’s theorem says that any Lebesgue mea-
surable function is continuous off a set of small measure, this suggests that almost all sample
functions should not be Lebesgue measurable from an intuitive point of view. The point
of Corollary 4.3 is that this intuitive fact can indeed be rigorously proven in a natural and
suitable analytic framework.
5. Rich product probability spaces
In this section, we study systematically the existence of measurable processes with es-
sentially pairwise independent random variables in a Fubini extension. We analyze the
problem through the concept of a rich product probability space, which is deﬁned to be a
Fubini extension that includes a measurable process with essentially i.i.d. random variables
of uniform distribution.
Deﬁnition 5.1. A Fubini extension (I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) is said to be a rich product
probability space if there is a real-valued I ⊠F-measurable process g on I × /afii9821with
essentially pairwise independent random variables g
i ,i ∈ I such that for /afii9838-almost all
i ∈ I , the random variablegi on (/afii9821, F,P) has uniform distribution on[0, 1].
25 Thus, the indeterminacy problem mentioned in[19] and Footnote 10 is solved; see also the discussion after
Proposition 6.1 in Section 6 below.

5.1. Properties of rich product probability spaces
Since for /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I , the random variable gi in Deﬁnition 5.1 has uniform
distribution, P is atomless. The following simple lemma shows that/afii9838is also atomless.
Lemma 5.2. Let (I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) be a rich product probability space. Then/afii9838is
atomless.
Proof. Suppose otherwise; letA be an atom of(I, I, /afii9838). Then forP-almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9821, the
/afii9838-integrable function g/afii9853must be essentially constant onA. Thus, forP-almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9821,
/afii9838-almost all i ∈ A, g/afii9853(i) =
∫
A g/afii9853d/afii9838//afii9838(A). By the Fubini property, we have for/afii9838-almost
all i ∈ A, gi is the random variable /afii9850deﬁned by
∫
A g/afii9853d/afii9838//afii9838(A). Thus /afii9850also has the
uniform distribution. However, the independence assumption implies that/afii9850is independent
of itself and thus a constant. This is a contradiction.□
As shown in the following proposition, a rich product probability space has the univer-
sality property in the sense that one can construct processes on it with essentially pairwise
independent random variables that take any given variety of distributions on a general Polish
space.
Proposition 5.3. Let X be a Polish space and/afii9850a measurable mapping from(I, I, /afii9838) to
the space M(X) of Borel probability measures on X, where M(X) is endowed with the
topology of weak convergence of measures. If(I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) is a rich product
probability space, then there is aI ⊠F-measurable process G fromI × /afii9821to X such that
the random variablesG
i are essentially pairwise independent, and the distributionPG −1
i
is the given distribution/afii9850(i) for /afii9838-almost alli ∈ I . 26
Let /afii9839be any Borel probability measure on the spaceM(X). Since (I, I, /afii9838) is atomless
by Lemma 5.2, any distribution can be generated by some measurable function on(I, I, /afii9838).
Thus, there is anI-measurable function /afii9850from I to M(X) whose distribution is the given
/afii9839. By applying Proposition 5.3 to this case, we know that there exists aI ⊠F-measurable
process G from I × /afii9821to X such that the random variables Gi are essentially pairwise
independent, and the distribution onM(X) generated by theI-measurable functionPG −1
i
from I to M(X) is the given/afii9839. The following corollary is obvious.
Corollary 5.4. If (I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) is a rich product probability space, then there is
a I ⊠F-measurable process G fromI × /afii9821to a Polish X with a distribution/afii9848such that the
random variablesGi are essentially pairwise independent with common distribution/afii9848.
26 The measurability of /afii9850with respect to the Borel algebra generated by the topology of weak convergence of
measures onM(X) is equivalent to the measurability of the real-valued functions/afii9850(·)(B) on I for all Borel setsB
in X; see, for example, Lemma 1 in[15]. It is obvious that for each Borel setB in X, PG −1
i (B) =
∫
/afii98211B (Gi )(/afii9853)dP
is measurable in terms ofi ∈ I . Thus PG −1
i deﬁnes an I-measurable function fromI to M(X).

The following proposition shows that one can produce new rich product probability spaces
from a given rich product probability space through the symmetric and subset properties.
Proposition 5.5. Let (I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) be a rich product probability space. Then we
have the following.
(1) The space(/afii9821×I, F ⊠I,P ⊠/afii9838), obtained by switching the index and sample variables,
is a rich product probability space. 27
(2) Let A ∈ I and B ∈ F with /afii9838(A) > 0 and P( B) >0. Deﬁne IA ={ C ∈ I : C ⊆ A},
FB ={ D ∈ F : D ⊆ B}, and (IA ⊠FB ) ={ E ∈ I ⊠F : E ⊆ (A×B)}. Let /afii9838A, P B ,
and (/afii9838A ⊠P B ) be the probability measures rescaled, respectively, from the restrictions
of /afii9838to IA, Pt o FB and /afii9838⊠P to (IA ⊠FB ). Then (A × B,( IA ⊠FB ), (/afii9838A ⊠P B ))
is a rich product probability space with marginals(A, IA, /afii9838A) and (B, FB ,P B ).
5.2. Existence of rich product probability spaces
For any two atomless Loeb probability spaces, their Loeb product (to be called an atomless
Loeb product space) is shown to extend the usual product by Anderson [3], retains the
Fubini property by Keisler [21], and can be endowed with essentially pairwise independent
processes with any variety of distributions in Theorem 6.2 of Sun [32].
28 Thus, atomless
Loeb product spaces (including the Loeb product of an atomless Loeb probability space
with itself) are always rich product probability spaces.
Next, we construct a rich product probability space by extending the usual continuum
product based on the Kolmogorov construction. Let/afii9806= R
[0,1] be the space of real-valued
functions on I =[ 0, 1], A the product /afii9846-algebra generated by the cylinders of the form
{/afii9853∈ /afii9806: /afii9853(i) ∈ B}for any Borel setB in R and i ∈ I , and/afii9839the continuum product measure
on (/afii9806, A) constructed from a probability distribution/afii9848on R. Note that the existence of such
a continuum product measure space is guaranteed by the Kolmogorov existence theorem
(see [6, p. 230]).
For i ∈ I , let f
i be the ith coordinate function, i.e., fi (/afii9853) = /afii9853(i), where /afii9853∈ /afii9806is a
function on I . Then, f is a real-valued process onI × /afii9806with a continuum of independent
and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variablesfi ,i ∈ I with a common distribution/afii9848.
Section 6.1 below shows that the continuum product measure space(/afii9806, A, /afii9839) is always a
bad sample space with any atomless index space. However, the following proposition shows
that some extension of(/afii9806, A, /afii9839) will have the desired properties.
Proposition 5.6. There is an atomless probability space (I, I, /afii9838) with I =[ 0, 1] and
a probability space (/afii9806, F,P) extending (/afii9806, A, /afii9839) such that (i) there is a rich product
probability space(I × /afii9806, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) ; (ii) the i.i.d. process f of coordinate functions is
I ⊠F-measurable.
27 This symmetric property also implies the atomlessness of/afii9838trivially since there is a processG such that G/afii9853
has uniform distribution on[0, 1] for P-almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9821.
28 Keisler and Sun[23] show that the Loeb product space is uniquely deﬁned by the marginal Loeb spaces.

6. Discussion
This section provides some discussion on the literature related to the exact law of large
numbers. Sections 6.1 and 6.2 show several major difﬁculties respectively for the usual
continuum product with the unit Lebesgue interval as the index space and for purely ﬁnitely
additive measure-theoretic framework. Section 6.3 presents some concluding remarks.
6.1. Difﬁculties with the usual continuum product
Let (/afii9806, A, /afii9839) be the continuum product space in Section 5.2, and f the coordinate
functions that form a real-valued i.i.d. process with a common distribution /afii9848. Since the
classical law of large numbers holds for a sequence of i.i.d. random variables, one may
hope an exact version of the law of large numbers to be valid forf so that the distributions
of almost all sample functionsf
/afii9853on the unit Lebesgue interval(I, L, /afii9840) are the theoretical
distribution /afii9848. However, it was already shown by Doob in [10, see Theorem 2.2, p. 113] that
the sample functions may not be Lebesgue measurable. The following proposition is taken
essentially from [10].
Proposition 6.1. F or any real-valued function h on[0, 1], let
M
h ={ /afii9853∈ /afii9806: f/afii9853(i) = h(i) except for countably manyi ∈ I }.
Then Mh has /afii9839-outer measure one. 29
Proof. Let A be any measurable set in the continuum product/afii9846-algebra A on /afii9806. ThenA is
determined on a countable index setC in the sense that for any/afii9825and /afii9826in /afii9806,i f /afii9825(i) = /afii9826(i)
for all i ∈ C, then /afii9825∈ A if and only if/afii9826∈ A.
Now suppose thatA contains Mh.T a k ea n y/afii9853∈ /afii9806. Deﬁne /afii9853′ so that it agrees with/afii9853
on C and with h on I − C. Since /afii9853′(i) = h(i) except for countably manyi ∈ I ,w eh a v e
/afii9853′ ∈ Mh, and hence/afii9853′ ∈ A. On the other hand, since/afii9853and /afii9853′ agree on C, the property
of C implies /afii9853∈ A also. This means thatA = /afii9806, and hence the outer measure/afii9839∗(Mh) of
Mh is one. □
It was noted in [10] that if one takesh to be non-Lebesgue measurable, then so is ev-
ery function in Mh. Thus, the setN of all non-Lebesgue measurable samples must have
/afii9839-outer measure one, and hence its complementN c of all Lebesgue measurable samples
has /afii9839-inner measure zero. On the other hand, if one takes a Lebesgue measurable function
h, then /afii9839∗(Mh) = 1 implies that the/afii9839-outer measure of the setN c to be one (see [19]).
Using the method in [11] (see p. 69), one can extend/afii9839to a measure ¯/afii9839on the /afii9846-algebra
generated by the setMh and the sets inA with ¯/afii9839(Mh) = 1. Thus, one obtains the absurd
29 Chiaki Hara asked the author the following question. Though the probability ofMh is indeterminate under
/afii9839(whose /afii9839-outer measure and /afii9839-inner measure are respectively one and zero), what is its probability under the
measure P in Proposition 5.6? If the functionh is not I-measurable, then P( Mh) = 0 since P -almost all sample
functions are I-measurable. If h is I-measurable, then Theorem4.2 says that P -almost no sample functions are
essentially measurable with respect to the countably generated/afii9846-algebra /afii9846(h); and henceP( Mh) is also 0 since
each function inMh is essentially /afii9846(h)-measurable.

claim that almost all sample functions are essentially equal to an arbitrarily given function
h. In particular, ifh is Lebesgue (or non-Lebesgue) measurable, then one can say that almost
all (or almost no) sample functions are Lebesgue measurable. In fact, the setN c can be
assigned a completely arbitrary new probabilityr for any r ∈[ 0, 1] (see [19]). This means
that the size of the set of Lebesgue measurable samples is completely indeterminate.
For any given number c, one can take h to be the constant function with value c, and
then claim that¯/afii9839-almost all sample functions are essentially constantc. When the common
mean m =
∫
R xd /afii9848exists, letc = m. One can thus claim that almost all sample means equal
the theoretical mean m. This appears to be an exact law of large numbers. However, it is
actually based on an absurd underlying statement, namely, almost all sample functions take
the constant valuem.
30 For example, when/afii9848concentrates at the points 0 and 1 with equal
probability 1
2 (the theoretical mean is thus1
2 ), this so-called exact law of large numbers is
actually based on the claim that almost all sample functions equal the constant function1
2
essentially. Since each random variablefi takes either 0 or 1 as its values essentially, there
is absolutely no valid reason to believe that almost all sample functions take the constant
value
1
2 . Hence, it is illegitimate to claim the validity of the exact law of large numbers in
this way.
The following simple result shows that(/afii9806, A, /afii9839) cannot be a marginal probability space
of a Fubini extension in whichf is measurable.
Proposition 6.2. Let I =[ 0, 1]. There is no atomless probability space(I, I, /afii9838) with the
following properties: (i)(I ×/afii9806, I ⊠A, /afii9838⊠/afii9839) is a Fubini extension with marginals(I, I, /afii9838)
and (/afii9806, A, /afii9839); (ii) the process f of coordinate functions isI ⊠A-measurable.
Proof. Suppose that there is an atomless probability space(I, I, /afii9838) with properties (i) and
(ii). Take an interval B in R such that /afii9848(B) < 1. Let c ∈ B, h be the constant function
on I with value c, and g = 1B ◦ f . Then, g is a bounded I ⊠A-measurable process
with mutually independent random variables. Corollary 2.9 shows that for /afii9839-almost all
/afii9853∈ /afii9806, /afii9838(f −1
/afii9853(B)) = Eg/afii9853= Eg = /afii9848(B) < 1. This implies that for/afii9839-almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9806,
f/afii9853= /afii9853/∈ Mh. 31 This means that/afii9839(Mh) = 0, which contradicts Proposition 6.1. □
Remark 6.3. (1) From the proof of Proposition6.1, one can observe that it is still valid for
any probability measure/afii9839on /afii9806which is not necessarily a continuum product measure as
stated earlier in [10]. Thus, one can still claim (by measure extension) that almost all sample
functions differ from an arbitrarily given functionh at only countably many points, which
also essentially equal h when I =[ 0, 1] is endowed with any given atomless probability
measure /afii9840
′.
(2) The requirement thatI is the unit interval in Proposition 6.1 is not essential. It can be
any space endowed with any atomless probability measure. In that case, one needs to work
with the general spaceR
I with A the usual product/afii9846-algebra constructed fromI copies of
the Borel algebra onR (see [6, p. 230]). Hence,(/afii9806, A) is always a bad sample space for
any process with any atomless index space.
30 Judd [19, p. 24]did point out that such kind of claim may appear to be weak straw to clutch.
31 If f/afii9853∈ Mh, then f/afii9853is essentially the constantc. Since c ∈ B, /afii9838(f −1
/afii9853(B)) = 1.

In the literature, individual risks are usually modeled by a nontrivial i.i.d. process whose
index space is the unit Lebesgue interval ([0, 1], L, /afii9840) and sample space the continuum
product space (/afii9806, A, /afii9839) based on the Kolmogorov construction. This mathematical model
does not ﬁt the economic assumption of individual risks in three aspects.
First, as noted in Remark6.3, (/afii9806, A, /afii9839) is always a bad sample space for the i.i.d. process
of coordinate functions with any atomless index space. One can draw an analogy here. The
algebra F
0 of cylinders in Section 6.2 below only depends on ﬁnitely many indexes. It is not
sufﬁcient for studying an inﬁnite sequence of independent random variables. While events
in A only depend on countably many indexes, the collection A of such events is again
inadequate for the study of a continuum of independent random variables. Proposition 6.2
also shows that it cannot be a marginal probability space of any Fubini extension in which
the relevant i.i.d process is measurable.
Second, ([0, 1], L, /afii9840) is not an appropriate index space for an independent process since
Corollary 4.3 actually shows that almost all sample functions cannot be Lebesgue mea-
surable in a richer framework. The fact that almost no sample functions are essentially
measurable with respect to any ﬁxed countably generated/afii9846-algebra implies that the sample
functions generate a “big”/afii9846-algebra on the index spaceI . When they are viewed based on a
comparatively much smaller/afii9846-algebra (say the Lebesgue/afii9846-algebra), too much information
about them is lost.
Third, the process is not jointly measurable in the usual product measure-theoretic frame-
work (Proposition 2.1), and thus it is not meaningful to integrate the process itself or take
its distribution.
6.2. Difﬁculties with ﬁnitely additive measure spaces
Section 6.1 shows how absurd results could be obtained when one attempts to study
a continuum of independent random variables in an inadequate mathematical model. The
purpose of this section is to present an analog for a sequence of independent random variables
in a ﬁnitely additive measure-theoretic framework.
Let /afii9848be a probability distribution on R, /afii9806
0 = R∞ the space of all sequences of real
numbers, and F0 the class of cylinders in the form B1 ×···× Bn × R∞ for Borel sets
B1,...,B n on R. Deﬁne a set function/afii98390 on F0 such that /afii98390(B1 ×···× Bn × R∞) =
/afii9848(B1) ×···× /afii9848(Bn). ThenF0 is an algebra of sets on/afii98060 and /afii98390 a ﬁnitely additive measure
on (/afii98060, F0). Deﬁne a sequence of i.i.d. random variables{gn}∞
n=1 on (/afii98060, F0, /afii98390) by letting
gn(/afii9853) = /afii9853n for /afii9853={ /afii9853n}∞
n=1 ∈ /afii98060. The following is an analog of Proposition 6.1.
Proposition 6.4. F or any sequence/afii9825={ an}∞
n=1 of real numbers, let M/afii9825be the set of all
sequences which differ from/afii9825at only ﬁnitely many terms. Then, M/afii9825is not measurable in
F0 and has /afii98390-outer measure one in the setting of ﬁnitely additive measures. Moreover,
there is a ﬁnitely additive measure space(/afii98060, ¯F0, ¯/afii98390) extending (/afii98060, F0, /afii98390) such that
M/afii9825∈ ¯F0 and ¯/afii98390(M/afii9825) = 1.
Proof. Pick any F ∈ F0 that contains M/afii9825. Then, there are Borel sets B1,...,B k in R
such that F = B1 ×···× Bk × R∞. Suppose F ̸= /afii98060. Then, there is an index 1⩽i0 ⩽k
and a real numberxi0 not in Bi0 . Let xn = an for any n ̸= i0. The sequence /afii9826={ xn}∞
n=1


--- PAGE 25 ---

Y.N. Sun / Journal of Economic Theory 126 (2006) 31 – 69 55
is in M/afii9825and hence inF, which impliesxi0 ∈ Bi0 . This is a contradiction. Thus,F = /afii98060.
Hence, M/afii9825has /afii98390-outer measure one in the setting of ﬁnite additive measures.
Let ¯F0 be the collection of sets in the formF = (F1 ∩M/afii9825)∪(F2 ∩Mc
/afii9825) with F1,F 2 ∈ F0,
and for such a setF, deﬁne ¯/afii98390(F )= /afii98390(F1) (see [11, p. 69]). The above result implies that
¯/afii98390 is a uniquely deﬁned ﬁnitely additive measure on the algebra¯F0 with ¯/afii98390(M/afii9825) = 1. □
Thus, in the ﬁnitely additive measure-theoretic framework, one can claim that almost
all sample sequences differ from any given sequence /afii9825of real numbers at only ﬁnitely
many terms. This is obviously absurd. By taking/afii9825such that(a1 +···+ an)/n diverges (or
converges to an arbitrary constantc)a s n goes to inﬁnity, one can say that the arithmetic
averages of almost all sample sequences diverge (or converge toc). 32 This also means that
results stated on ﬁnitely additive measures may be arbitrary and completely unreliable. In the
context of ﬁnitely additive measures, the outer and inner measures of the set of all samples
/afii9853such that (g
1(/afii9853) +···+ gn(/afii9853))/n converges asn goes to inﬁnity are also, respectively,
one and zero, and thus can be assigned an arbitrary value in[0, 1] by extension. This is
analogous to the indeterminacy problem mentioned in Section 6.1.
As already shown by Kolmogorov, all these anomalies can be removed by the axiomatic
condition of a countably additive measure on a/afii9846-algebra. In particular, for any sequence
{fn}∞
n=1 of i.i.d. real-valued random variables on any countably additive measure space
(/afii9821, F,P) with a common meanm, the law of large numbers holds: forP-almost all/afii9853∈ /afii9821,
limn→∞ (f1(/afii9853) +···+ fn(/afii9853))/n = m. In addition, assume that the sequence{fn}∞
n=1 is
bounded. Then for those samples/afii9853such that limn→∞ (f1(/afii9853)+···+ fn(/afii9853))/n = m, some
Banach limits corresponding to the density charges for the sequence{fn(/afii9853)}∞
n=1 are also
m. 33 Since such a Banach limit can be viewed as an integral of a bounded sequence of real
numbers with respect to a density charge/afii9835(which is a purely ﬁnitely additive measure),
Kolmogorov’s strong law of large numbers can thus beweakened to the statement that the
/afii9835-integral of almost all sample functions ism. This weakened statement was claimed in [12]
as an exact version of the law of large numbers.
There are serious problems with this weakened statement on the law of large numbers
in terms of the purely ﬁnitely additive measure /afii9835on the index set Z+. It is well known
that one cannot conduct any limit operations with such a measure and thus mathematical
analysis is not applicable.
34 It also has no basic properties, such as the essentially uniquely
deﬁned (exact) Radon–Nikodym derivatives, and thus no concepts of density functions or
conditioning (which are important for probabilistic arguments). In addition, as shown in
32 If the common mean is m, one can claim that for almost all /afii9853, the sequence {gn(/afii9853)}∞
n=1 differs from the
constant sequences with valuem at only ﬁnitely many terms, and hence limn→∞ (g1(/afii9853) +···+ gn(/afii9853))/n = m.
One certainly cannot regard this statement as a law of large numbers.
33 Such a Banach limit is simply a bounded linear functionalL on the space l∞ of bounded sequences of real
numbers such that for any sequence/afii9825={ an}∞
n=1 ∈ l∞ with limn→∞ (a1 +···+ an)/n = a, L(/afii9825) = a; see
[12]. Note that such Banach limits are not unique, and hence the density charges are not unique.
34 See the argument against the use of ﬁnitely additive measures in this context in[5]. For example, the main
tool associated with measure-theoretic economies, integration theory of correspondences fails in a purely ﬁnitely
additive measure-theoretic framework; and it seems that no reasonable result on the existence of equilibrium is
even shown in such a framework.

the following proposition, if one works with the index spaceZ+ endowed with a density
charge /afii9835, then one can derive the result that every sample distribution (which is purely ﬁnitely
additive) 35 cannot be the countably additive theoretical distribution/afii9848when /afii9848has a nontrivial
continuous part.36 This shows further that results on ﬁnitely additive measure spaces may
be totally unreliable. In one case, it may say something that shares some similarity with
what one wants; in another case, it may lead to something completely meaningless.
Proposition 6.5. Assume that the probability distribution /afii9848has a nontrivial continuous
part. Then, for every sample realization/afii9853∈ /afii9821, the sample distribution/afii9848
/afii9853is not equal to
the theoretical distribution/afii9848.
Proof. Note that for every /afii9853∈ /afii9821, /afii9848/afii9853only concentrates on the countable set C/afii9853=
{fn(/afii9853) : n ∈ Z+}, and hence /afii9848/afii9853(R \ C/afii9853) = 0. Since /afii9848has a nontrivial continuous part
(denoted by /afii9848c), we know that 0< /afii9848c(R) = /afii9848c(R \ C/afii9853)⩽/afii9848(R \ C/afii9853). Therefore, /afii9848̸= /afii9848/afii9853
for every /afii9853∈ /afii9821. □
In a recent paper[2], Al-Najjar proposed to use a purely ﬁnitely additive measure¯/afii9838con-
centrated on a countable dense subsetT of [0, 1] to handle the exact law of large numbers in
terms of sample means for a continuum of independent random variables (see, for example,
[2, Section 3.4]). Since this is still in a purely ﬁnitely additive measure-theoretic framework,
the above difﬁculties remain in this framework; in particular, it will not make much sense
to state the law of large numbers in terms of sample distributions or ﬁnite-dimensional
distributions in terms of¯/afii9838as in our Section 2. In addition, among the continuum of agents,
only the countably many agents inT matter and the rest are dummy agents who have no
real effect on the market at all. Thus, the continuum model considered in [2] is, in fact, a
countable model plus a continuum of dummy agents.
6.3. Concluding remarks
As a mathematical result, the law of large numbers is a conditional statement that involves
two parts. The ﬁrst is the condition of independence or its generalizations. The second is the
conclusion on the stability of sample means or distributions. The result says thatwhenever
the condition is satisﬁed, the sample means or distributions will not depend on particular
sample realizations. This conditional statement only holds in a suitable analytic framework.
One needs to work with a countably additive measure on a/afii9846-algebra in the discrete set-
ting, and with the framework of a Fubini extension in the continuum setting. When one does
not work within a suitable analytic framework,
37 the general conditional statement may fail
35 For a sample realization /afii9853∈ /afii9821, the sample distribution /afii9848/afii9853can be naturally deﬁned by letting /afii9848/afii9853(B) =
/afii9835({n : fn(/afii9853) ∈ B}) for any Borel setB in R.
36 For example, /afii9848is the uniform distribution on[0, 1].
37 For example, when one only works with a ﬁnitely additive measure structure in the discrete case or with a
continuum index process in a framework without the Fubini property.

badly as illustrated in[12,19] and in Sections 6.1 and 6.2. It needs to be emphasized that the
law of large numbers is not an existence result stating the existence of a process satisfying
both the condition of independence and the stability of sample means (or distributions).
The classical law of large numbers says that for a sequence of independent and identically
distributed random variables, the sample mean/distribution is close to the common theoret-
ical mean/distribution. Using nonstandard analysis, one can simply transfer the same result
to the nonstandard model to claim the existence of a continuum of independent random
variables whose sample mean/distribution is constant (Footnote 45 is relevant here). How-
ever, one does not obtain an exact law of large numbers for a continuum of independent
random variables in this way since the transferred version of independence (namely the
∗-independence condition) is much stronger than the usual independence condition in the
nonstandard model as used in [32]. Also the transferred law of large numbers has exactly
the same mathematical content as the classical law of large numbers since one simply inter-
prets the same mathematical sentence in different mathematical models.
38 However, this
does show the existence of a process satisfying both the condition of independence and the
stability of sample means (or distributions). Other existence examples can also be found in
[4,13,19], which show that the condition of independence with identical distribution has no
logical contradiction with the stability of sample means or distributions.
Note that the independence condition or its generalizations is a crucial component in
the statement of the law of large numbers. These conditions have very important empirical
and behavioral content. For example, when one models the real-world situation that some
economic agents make decisions or receive signals independently of each other, one uses the
mathematical condition of independence. If the independence condition is simply dropped,
one can certainly produce many examples of processes that have stable sample means
or distributions.
39 However, the processes in these examples may not have any useful
economic content. For example, one may allow half of the random variables in a process
to be a ﬁxed real-valued random variable/afii9850with mean zero and the other half−/afii9850, then all
sample means are exactly zero, which is the common mean of all the random variables.
40
No one would regard this example as a law of large numbers.
Let fi ,i ∈ I be a collection of mutually orthogonal square-integrable random variables
on (/afii9821, F,P) with mean zero. Then, for any square-integrable random variable/afii9850, the inner
product
∫
/afii9821/afii9850(/afii9853) · fi (/afii9853)dP( /afii9853) = 0 except for countably manyi ∈ I . When/afii9838is atomless,
one must have
∫
I
∫
/afii9821
/afii9850(/afii9853) · fi (/afii9853)dP( /afii9853)d /afii9838(i) = 0, (6)
since the outer integral integrates a function that is zero almost surely. This is a standard
example of Birkhoff showing that a continuum of mutually orthogonal random variables
38 The transferred law was used by Keisler in[21] to study probability model theory.
39 On the other hand, if one requires the stability of sample means or distributions on all the nonnegligible
coalitions, the converse law of large numbers in Theorems2.6 and 2.8 does show that the original process must
be essentially uncorrelated or essentially pairwise independent.
40 Feldman–Gilles proposed a similar example in terms of distributions in Proposition 2 of Feldman and Gilles
[12], where the independence condition was dropped.

Pettis-integrate to zero.41 The type of result in Eq. (6) is used to justify the exact law of
large numbers in terms of sample means in [35].42 However, Eq. (6) actually says that the
average of the joint moment offi ,i ∈ I with another random variable/afii9850is zero, which is
totally different from the desired conclusion that the sample mean
∫
I f/afii9853(i) d/afii9838(i) is almost
surely zero. Thus, it is difﬁcult to use the Pettis integral as in Eq. (6) to justify the exact
law of large numbers even in the simple case of sample means. This point has been noted
in [24] (see also [2, p. 22] for some comments related to this).
This paper shows that the mathematical framework of a Fubini extension is sufﬁcient for
a meaningful study of individual risks. In particular, the earlier literature that uses various
versions of the exact law of large numbers in an incorrect way can be easily validated.
One can simply replace the product of the unit Lebesgue interval with a sample probability
space used in that literature by a Fubini extention(I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) with an atomless
measure /afii9838and then appeal to an appropriate version of the exact law of large numbers in
Section 2. The other point of the paper is that the framework of a Fubini extension allows
one to discover completely new phenomena that have no known discrete analogs, such as
the converse law of large numbers in Theorems 2.6 and 2.8, and the characterization of
insurable risks in Theorem 3.10.

Proof. (i) The Fubini property implies that for/afii9838-almost all s ∈ I , /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I , both
the functions gs (/afii9853) and hi (/afii9853) in terms of /afii9853∈ /afii9821are P-square integrable; and hence the
product G(s, i,/afii9853) = a(s)g(s, /afii9853)h(i, /afii9853)b(i) is P-integrable for /afii9853∈ /afii9821.
(ii) The product of any real-valued functions/afii9850and /afii9852that are, respectively,P-square inte-
grable on/afii9821and /afii9838-square integrable onI is still square integrable on(I ×/afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) .
Thus, the product/afii9850(/afii9853)h(i, /afii9853)/afii9852(i) is integrable on(I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) .
For /afii9838-almost alls ∈ I , gs is P-square integrable; and hence the productgs (/afii9853)h(i, /afii9853)b(i)
is integrable on (I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) . It also follows easily from the Cauchy–Schwartz
inequality that both

∫
I a(s)g(s, /afii9853)d /afii9838(s) are P-square integrable.

Lemma A.2. Let f be a real-valued square integrable process on a Fubini extension
(I × /afii9821, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) . If the random variablesfi are essentially uncorrelated and have a
common mean m, then any given/afii9838-square integrable function on(I, I, /afii9838) is uncorrelated
with the sample functionf/afii9853for P-almost all/afii9853∈ /afii9821.

∫
I a(i)(f (i,/afii9853)−m) d/afii9838(i) =
0 for P-almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9821. On the other hand, the exact law of large numbers in Proposi-
tion 2.5 implies that Ef/afii9853= m for P-almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9821. Therefore, a(·) and f/afii9853(·) are
uncorrelated for P-almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9821. □
Proof of Theorem 2.12. We only consider (i)/equal1⇒ (ii). By Corollary 2.9, the sample func-
tion f/afii9853has distribution /afii9839for P-almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9821.
As in the proof of Theorem 2.8, ﬁx a countable open base{On}∞
n=1 for X so that it is
closed under ﬁnite intersections. Take anym, n⩾1. Then the process 1On (f )has essentially
uncorrelated random variables. Lemma A.2 implies that forP-almost allq ∈ /afii9821, the functions
1Om (fq ) and 1On (f/afii9853) on I are uncorrelated for P-almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9821, which means that
Eq. (5) holds here by interchanging the variablesi and /afii9853. The proof for essential pairwise
independence of thefi ’s after Eq. (5) still applies here; and hence the sample functionsf/afii9853
are essentially pairwise independent. □
Proof of Lemma 2.13. When T = Z+, the result is clear. For the case of continuous
parameters, let
E ={ D ∈ (I ⊠F) ⊗ BT : Di ∈ F ⊗ BT for /afii9838-almost alli ∈ I }.
Then it is clear that for anyC ∈ I ⊠F,B ∈ BT , C×B ∈ E. It can also be checked thatE is a
/afii9838-system. By applying Dynkin’s /afii9843-/afii9838theorem (see [8, p. 44]), we obtain
that E = (I ⊠F) ⊗ BT . Thus there is a /afii9838-null subset N of I such that for any i/∈ N ,
{(/afii9853,t) ∈ /afii9821× T : Fi (/afii9853, t )<r}∈ F ⊗ BT holds for all rational numbersr ∈ Q. The rest
is clear. □

Proof of Theorem2.16. Deﬁne a process G from I × /afii9821into R∞ by letting G(i, /afii9853) =
{F( i ,/afii9853,t n)}∞
n=1. Then, for/afii9838⊠P -almost all (i, /afii9853) ∈ I × /afii9821,
F( i ,/afii9853,t) = /afii9852(G(i, /afii9853), t) (A.4)
for all t ∈ T . The fact that the stochastic processesFi are essentially pairwise independent
implies that the random variablesGi are essentially pairwise independent. Here, we use the
fact that the Borel algebra onR∞ is generated by the cylinders of a ﬁnite product of Borel
sets in R with inﬁnitely many copies ofR.
By Theorem2.8, we have forP-almost all/afii9853∈ /afii9821, the distribution/afii9839/afii9853on R∞ induced by
the random variableG/afii9853on I is equal to the distribution/afii9839on R∞ induced by G on I × /afii9821.
Also, the Fubini property implies that forP-almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9821, Eq. (A.4) holds for/afii9838-almost
i ∈ I and for all t ∈ T . Take such an/afii9853with both properties, and choose anyt1,...,t n
from T. For any bounded continuous functions/p10on Rn,w eh a v e

Hence, the stochastic processesF/afii9853and F have the the same ﬁnite-dimensional distributions,
and we are done. □
Proof of Theorem 2.17. We ﬁrst show thatF (viewed as a stochastic process with sample
space I × /afii9821) and H have the same ﬁnite-dimensional distributions. Note that essential
pairwise independence is not needed for this point. Choose t1,...,t n from T. For any
bounded continuous functions/p10on Rn,w eh a v e

Hence F and H have the same ﬁnite-dimensional distributions.
Next, by the essential pairwise independence assumption on the stochastic processesFi ,
Theorem 2.16 implies that forP-almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9821, the empirical processF/afii9853has the same
ﬁnite-dimensional distributions asF, and henceH.
It remains to show that the empirical processesF/afii9853are essentially pairwise independent.
As in the proof of Theorem 2.16, we use the expression in Eq. (A.4). It is easy to see that
the random variables Gi are essentially pairwise independent and identically distributed.

By Theorem 2.12, the sample functionsG/afii9853are also essentially pairwise independent and
identically distributed. Then, forP-almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9821, P-almost all /afii9853′ ∈ /afii9821,
F/afii9853(i, t)= /afii9852(G/afii9853(i), t), F /afii9853′(i, t)= /afii9852(G/afii9853′(i), t) (A.5)
for /afii9838-almost i ∈ I and for allt ∈ T ; and G/afii9853and G/afii9853′ are independent. Thus, the empirical
processes F/afii9853and F/afii9853′ are independent. The rest follows from symmetry. □
A.2. Proof of some results in Section 3
Proof of Lemma 3.2. (1) Let /afii9797k be the set of all probability measures q on Sk with
q({s})> 0 for all s ∈ Sk. For a given complete continuous preordering ⪯ in Pk and a
probability measure q ∈ /afii9797k, deﬁne a mappingEq from (Rm
+)Sk
to Rm
+ by letting Eq (x) =∑
s∈Sk q({s})x(s) for each x ∈ (Rm
+)Sk
. For any given a ∈ Rm
+, the set (Eq )−1({a}) =
{z ∈ (Rm
+)Sk
: Eq z = a} is compact since q({s})> 0 for all s ∈ Sk. In fact, it is easy to
check that Eq (·) is a closed mapping. It is also an open mapping since it is linear (see [30,
p. 230]). Thus, Theorem 14.7 on p. 463 of Aliprantis and Border [1] implies that(Eq )−1(·)
deﬁnes a continuous compact-valued correspondence fromRm
+ to (Rm
+)Sk
.
Deﬁne a correspondence/afii9850k from Pk ×/afii9797k ×Rm
+ to (Rm
+)Sk
by letting/afii9850k(⪯ ,q,a ) be the
nonempty set of all maximal elements in the compact set(Eq )−1({a}) under the complete
continuous preordering ⪯ . It is easy to check that /afii9850k a compact valued correspondence
with a closed graph. It is obvious that elements in/afii9850k(⪯ ,q,a ) are indifferent to each other
under ⪯ . Take anotherb ∈ Rm
+. There is no confusion to use/afii9850k(⪯ ,q,a ) ⪯ /afii9850k(⪯ ,q,b )
to mean that there are x ∈ /afii9850k(⪯ ,q,a ) and y ∈ /afii9850k(⪯ ,q,b ) with x ⪯ y. Thus, we can
deﬁne a binary relation⪯ q on Rm
+ such that for anya, b∈ Rm
+, a ⪯ q b holds if and only if
/afii9850k(⪯ ,q,a ) ⪯ /afii9850k(⪯ ,q,b ) holds.
Then it is obvious that⪯ q is a reﬂexive, transitive and complete binary relation (thus a
complete preordering). We shall show that⪯ q is also a continuous preordering. Suppose that
an,b n ∈ Rm
+ for n = 0, 1, 2,... with an ⪯ q bn for n⩾1 and limn→∞ (an,b n) = (a0,b 0).
Take xn ∈ /afii9850k(⪯ ,q,a n) and yn ∈ /afii9850k(⪯ ,q,b n) for n⩾1. Since the set ∪∞
n=0 {an,b n} is
compact and since q({s})> 0 for all s ∈ Sk, one can ﬁnd convergent subsequences
{xnk }∞
k=1 and {ynk }∞
k=1 with respective limitsx0 and y0. Since /afii9850k(⪯ ,q, ·) also has a closed
graph, one obtains thatx0 ∈ /afii9850k(⪯ ,q,a 0) and y0 ∈ /afii9850k(⪯ ,q,b 0). By the deﬁnition of⪯ q ,
one also hasxnk ⪯ ynk for all k ⩾1. The continuity of⪯ implies x0 ⪯ y0. This means that
a0 ⪯ q b0. Thus the preordering⪯ q is continuous.
Next, take any 1⩽k ⩽K.F o ri ∈ I k, it is clear that the binary relation⪯ −
i on Rm
+ in the
statement of Lemma 3.2 is simply⪯ /afii9843i
i , corresponding to the preordering⪯ i and probability
measure /afii9843i . Then, ⪯ −
i is indeed a continuous complete preordering as shown above.

measurable selections of /afii9818k

we know that the set{i ∈ I k : /p10k
a(i) ⪯ i /p10k
b(i)} is measurable. Since /afii9850k(⪯ i , /afii9843i , a(i)) ⪯ i
/afii9850k(⪯ i , /afii9843i , b(i))actually means/p10k
a(i) ⪯ i /p10k
b(i), we know that the set{i ∈ I : a(i) ⪯ −
i b(i)}
is measurable. □
Proof of Lemma 3.3. First, assume that (x, p) is an equilibrium in E.T a k ea n yz ∈
E−1
i ({Ei xi }); then pEi z = pEi xi . Since xi is a maximal element in agent i’s budget
set for /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I ,w eh a v ez ⪯ i xi , i.e., xi ∈ /afii9818a(i).
Next, consider thatx is a Pareto-optimal allocation inE. Let B ={ i ∈ I k : xi ≺i /p10k
a(i)}
and suppose /afii9838(B) > 0. Then deﬁne an allocationy such that y(i) = /p10k
a(i) for i ∈ B, and
y(i) = x(i) for i ∈ I − B. It is clear thatEi yi = Ei xi for all i ∈ I . Since x is feasible, y
is also a feasible allocation inE, which is strictly better thanx for agents inB and the same
as x for other agents. This contradicts the Pareto optimality ofx. □
Before proving the results on Pareto optimality, we present a useful simple lemma.
Lemma A.3. F or any1 ⩽k ⩽K, if y ∈ (Rm
+)Sk
, and i ∈ I k, then y ⪯ i z for any z ∈
/afii9820k(i, Ei y).
Proof. Note that y belongs to the set (Ei )−1(Ei y). Since z is a maximal element in
(Ei )−1(Ei y) under ⪯ i . The rest is clear. □
Proof of Proposition 3.4. (1) /equal1⇒ (2): The second part of (2) follows from Lemma 3.3.
Suppose that there exists a feasible allocation b in ¯E such that ai ⪯ −
i bi for all i ∈ I
with /afii9838({i ∈ I l : ai ≺−
i bi })> 0 for some 1⩽l ⩽K. Deﬁne an allocationy in E such that
y(i) = /p10k
b(i) for i ∈ I k,k = 1,...,K . Then it is clear that y is still feasible. By the
deﬁnition of ⪯ −
i ,w eh a v exi ⪯ −
i yi for all i ∈ I , and /afii9838({i ∈ I l : xi ≺−
i yi })> 0 for some
1 ⩽l ⩽K. This contradicts the Pareto optimality ofx.
(2) /equal1⇒ (1): Suppose that there exists a feasible allocationy such that xi ⪯ i yi for all
i ∈ I with /afii9838({i ∈ I l : xi ≺−
i yi })> 0 for some 1 ⩽l ⩽K. Let b(i) = Ei yi . Lemma
A.3 says that for any k, yi ⪯ /p10k
b(i) for all i ∈ I k. Hence, /p10b is a feasible allocation
in E, and xi ⪯ −
i /p10b(i) for all i ∈ I , and /afii9838({i ∈ I l : xi ≺−
i /p10k
b(i)})> 0 for some
1 ⩽l ⩽K. By the deﬁnition of⪯ −
i and the second part of (2), we know thatai ⪯ −
i bi for
all i ∈ I with /afii9838({i ∈ I l : ai ≺−
i bi })> 0 for some 1⩽l ⩽K. This contradicts the Pareto
optimality of a. □
Proof of Proposition 3.5. (1) For any d ∈ Rm
+ with ai ⪯ −
i d,w eh a v e/p10a(i) ⪯ i z for
some z ∈ /afii9820(i, d). Lemma A.3 implies thatxi ⪯ i /p10a(i), and hence xi ⪯ i z. Since (x, p)
be a pseudo-equilibrium, we have, pai ⩽pEi z, i.e., pai ⩽pd. Thus, (a, p) is a pseudo-
equilibrium in the economy ¯E.
(2) Take anyz ∈ (Rm
+)Si with yi ⪯ i z. Then, Lemma A.3 implies thatz ⪯ i v for some
v ∈ /afii9820(i, Ei z), and hence,yi ⪯ i v. Thus,bi ⪯ −
i Ei z. Since(b, p)be a pseudo-equilibrium,
we have, pbi ⩽pEi z, i.e., pEi yi ⩽pEi z. Thus, (y, p) is a pseudo-equilibrium in the
economy E. □

Proof of Proposition 3.6. (1) For anyd ∈ Rm
+ with pd ⩽pai ,w eh a v epEi z⩽pEi xi for
some z ∈ /afii9820(i, d). Since (x, p)be an equilibrium, we havez ⪯ i xi . Lemma A.3 implies
that xi ⪯ i /p10a(i), and hence z ⪯ i /p10a(i). Thus, d = Ei z ⪯ −
i ai . This means that(a, p)is
an equilibrium in the economy¯E.
(2) Take anyz ∈ (Rm
+)Si with pEi z⩽pEi yi = pbi . Since (b, p)be an equilibrium, we
have Ei z ⪯ −
i bi . By Lemma A.3 and the deﬁnition of⪯ −
i , we obtainz ⪯ i yi . Hence,(y, p)
is an equilibrium in the economyE. □
Proof of Proposition 3.7. The monotonicity of⪯ −
i and Lemma 3.2 imply that Conditions
(ii) and (iii) on p. 366 of Hildenbrand [16] are satisﬁed. Thus, it follows from the theorem
on p. 367 of Hildenbrand [16] (the other conditions of the theorem are trivially satisﬁed)
that there is a price systemp such that (a, p)is a pseudo-equilibrium in ¯E. Based on some
standard method (see, for example, [5]), the monotonicity of⪯
−
i and the strict positivity of
the average expected endowment imply thatp is strictly positive. Hence (1)/equal1⇒ (2) follows.
Next, we consider (2) /equal1⇒ (3). Assume that (a, p)is a pseudo-equilibrium in ¯E with a
strictly positive price systemp.T a k ea n yb ∈ Rm
+ with pb ⩽pai .I f pb = 0, then b = 0,
and b ⪯ −
i ai by monotonicity. Ifpb > 0, one can ﬁnd a sequencebn ∈ Rm
+,n = 1, 2,...
with pbn <p bsuch that the sequence converges tob. Thuspbn <p ai , which implies that
bn ⪯ −
i ai . By continuity of the preference,b ⪯ −
i ai .
The thin preference condition as deﬁned in [16] is obviously satisﬁed. Thus, (3)/equal1⇒ (1)
follows from the argument on p. 366 of Hildenbrand [16].□
Proof of Corollary 3.8. (1) /equal1⇒ (2) follows from Lemma 3.3, Propositions 3.4, 3.5 and
3.7. The same proof for (2)/equal1⇒ (3) in Proposition 3.7 also applies here. (3)/equal1⇒ (1) follows
from Lemma 3.3, Propositions 3.4, 3.6 and 3.7. □
A.3. Proof of Theorem 4.2
Before proving Theorem 4.2, we need to prove the following lemma.
Lemma A.4. Let g be a square integrable process on a Fubini extension(I × /afii9821, I ⊠F,
/afii9838⊠P) such that the random variables gi are essentially uncorrelated, and C any ﬁxed
countably generated sub-/afii9846-algebra of I. If there is a subsetB0 of /afii9821with outer measure
P ∗(B0)> 0 such that for all/afii9853∈ B0, g/afii9853is essentiallyC-measurable, then there is a P-null
set S0 such that for all/afii9853∈ B0 − S0, g/afii9853(i) = Egi for /afii9838-almost alli ∈ I .
Proof. For any given measurable setA ∈ I, Theorem 2.6 implies that
∫
A
g/afii9853(i) d/afii9838(i) =
∫
A
Egi d/afii9838(i) (A.6)
holds for P-almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9821.
Let C0 be a countable collection of sets inC that includes I , generates C and is closed
under ﬁnite intersections. Leth be the conditional expectation of the mean functionEgi with

respect to C. Then, for any C ∈ C,
∫
C h(i) d/afii9838(i) =
∫
C Egi d/afii9838(i); and hence Eq. (A.6)
implies that
∫
C
g/afii9853(i) d/afii9838(i) =
∫
C
h(i) d/afii9838(i) (A.7)
holds for P-almost all /afii9853∈ /afii9821. By grouping countably manyP-null sets together, one can
ﬁnd a P-null set S0 such that for all/afii9853/∈ S0, g/afii9853is /afii9838-square integrable, and Eq. (A.7) holds
for all C ∈ C0, which means that the conditional expectation E(g/afii9853|C) is simply h (see
Theorem 1 on p. 212 of Chow and Teicher [7]).
Let E0 = B0 − S0. Fix /afii9853∈ E0. There is a function ¯g/afii9853which equals g/afii9853essentially
on (I, I, /afii9838) such that ¯g/afii9853is C-measurable. Thus, E(g/afii9853|C) = E( ¯g/afii9853|C) =¯g/afii9853= h hold
essentially on (I, I, /afii9838). Hence g/afii9853(i) = h(i) for /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I .
For any ﬁxedA ∈ I, since P ∗(E0)> 0, we can ﬁnd/afii9853∈ E0 such that g/afii9853(i) = h(i) for
/afii9838-almost alli ∈ I and Eq. (A.6) also holds for such a/afii9853. Hence
∫
A h(i) d/afii9838(i) =
∫
A Egi d/afii9838(i).
Since A is arbitrary, we obtain thatEgi = h(i) for /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I . Therefore, for all
/afii9853∈ E0, g/afii9853(i) = Egi for /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I . □
Proof of Theorem 4.2. Suppose that it is not true that almost all the random variablesfi
are constant. Let B0 be the set of all /afii9853∈ /afii9821such that f/afii9853is essentially C-measurable.
Suppose P ∗(B0)> 0.
By the usual Borel isomorphism theorem [8, p. 275], there is a Borel measurable mapping
/p10from X to [0, 1] such that /p10is one-to-one. Letp = /p10◦ f . Then, the random variablespi
are still essentially pairwise independent. Take any rational numberr. Letg = 1(−∞,r] ◦p.
Then g satisﬁes the condition of Lemma A.4. Hence, there is aP-null set S0 such that for
all /afii9853∈ B0 − S0, g/afii9853(i) = Egi holds for /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I . Since p itself also satisﬁes the
condition of Lemma A.4, we know that there is aP-null set ¯S0 such that for all/afii9853∈ B0 − ¯S0,
p/afii9853(i) = Epi holds for /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I . Since P ∗(B0)> 0, B0 − (S0 ∪ ¯S0) is nonempty.
Take /afii9853∈ B0 − (S0 ∪ ¯S0). Then, for/afii9838-almost all i ∈ I ,
g/afii9853(i) = 1(−∞,r](p/afii9853(i)) = 1(−∞,r](Epi ) = Egi = E
(
1(−∞,r] ◦ pi
)
= Fi (r),
(A.8)
where Fi is the distribution function ofpi . It is easy to see that 1(−∞,r](Epi ) = 1[Epi ,∞)(r),
and hence Fi (r) = 1[Epi ,∞)(r) for /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I . By grouping countably many
/afii9838-null sets together, we obtain that for /afii9838-almost all i ∈ I , Fi (r) = 1[Epi ,∞)(r) for all
rational numbersr, which implies thatpi is the constant random variable taking valueEpi .
Since /p10is one-to-one, we derive that for/afii9838-almost all i ∈ I , the random variables fi are
constant, which contradicts the hypothesis. Therefore, P ∗(B0) = 0, which implies that
P( B0) = 0. □
A.4. Proof of the results in Section 5
We reproduce Lemma 2.22 on p. 34 in[20] using our notation for the convenience of the
reader.

Lemma A.5. Let /afii9848be the Lebesgue measure on the Borel algebraB on [0, 1], and /p10a mea-
surable mapping from a measurable space(S, S) to the spaceM(X) of Borel probability
measures on a Polish space X, where M(X) is endowed with the topology of weak conver-
gence of measures. 43 Then there exists someS⊗B-measurable functionf : S×[0, 1]→ X
such that for anys ∈ S, the distribution/afii9848f −1
s is /p10(s).
Proof of Proposition 5.3. By the richness assumption, there is aI ⊠F-measurable pro-
cess g from I × /afii9821to [0, 1] such that the random variables gi are essentially pairwise
independent with the uniform distribution /afii9848on [0, 1]. By Lemma A.5, there is aI ⊗ B-
measurable function f : I ×[ 0, 1]→ X such that for anyi ∈ I , the distribution /afii9848f −1
i is
/afii9850(i). Deﬁne a mappingG from I × /afii9821to X by letting G(i, /afii9853) = f (i, g(i,/afii9853)). Then, for
/afii9838-almost all i ∈ I , the distribution
PG −1
i = (P g−1
i )f −1
i = /afii9848f −1
i = /afii9850(i).
It is also obvious that for/afii9838-almost alli ∈ I , Gi = fi (gi ) and Gs = fs (gs ) are independent
for /afii9838-almost all s ∈ I . 44
What remains is to check theI ⊠F-measurability ofG. Deﬁne a measurable mappingH
from (I ×/afii9821, I ⊠F) to (I ×[0, 1], I ⊗B) by lettingH( i ,/afii9853) = (i, g(i,/afii9853)). For any Borel
set B in X, f −1(B) is in I ⊗ B; and hence H −1(f −1(B)) is in I ⊠F. Since G−1(B) =
H −1(f −1(B)), we thus obtain theI ⊠F-measurability of G. □
Proof of Proposition 5.5. (1) By the deﬁnition of a rich product probability space, there
is a real-valuedI ⊠F-measurable function g on I × /afii9821such that for/afii9838-almost all i ∈ I , the
random variablegi on (/afii9821, F,P) has the uniform distribution/afii9848on [0, 1] and is independent
of the random variablegs for /afii9838-almost all s ∈ I . By Theorem 2.12, the sample functions
f/afii9853have exactly the same property. The rest is clear.
(2) LetgA and gA×B be the respective restrictions ofg to A×/afii9821and toA×B. It is obvious
that (A×/afii9821, IA ⊠F, /afii9838A ⊠P) is a rich product probability space since the random variables
gi ,i ∈ A are still essentially pairwise independent with uniform distribution/afii9848on [0, 1].B y
Theorem 2.12, the sample functionsgA
/afii9853, /afii9853∈ /afii9821are essentially pairwise independent with
distribution /afii9848, which implies that the sample functionsgA×B
/afii9853, /afii9853∈ B have the same property.
By Theorem 2.12 again, the random variablesgA×B
i ,i ∈ A are also essentially pairwise
independent with distribution /afii9848. The Fubini property for(A × B, IA ⊠FB , /afii9838A ⊠P B ) is
clear; and hence, it is a rich product probability space with marginals (A, IA, /afii9838A) and
(B, FB ,P B ). □
Proof of Proposition 5.6. Take an atomless hyperﬁnite Loeb space (I0, I0, /afii98380) and an-
other atomless Loeb space (/afii98210, F0,P 0) constructed using the usual ultrapower
43 The second measurability condition mentioned in Footnote 26 above is used in[20]. That is equivalent to the
measurability condition used here.
44 When one can choose the random variablesgi ,i ∈ I to be pairwise or mutually independent as in Footnote
45 and in the proof of Proposition 5.6 below, the random variables Gi ,i ∈ I are also pairwise or mutually
independent.

construction (see [27]) such that there is a measurable real-valued process¯g on the Loeb
product space (T0 × /afii98210, I0 ⊠F0, /afii98380 ⊠P0) whose random variables ¯gi are mutually inde-
pendent with uniform distribution/afii9848on [0, 1]. 45
Since a hyperﬁnite set in the ultrapower construction on N only involves sequences
of ﬁnite sets, the usual external cardinality of I0 is the cardinality of the continuum.
Let /afii9850be a bijection from the unit interval I =[ 0, 1] to I0. Then, there is an atomless
probability space (I, I, /afii9838) such that /afii9850is an isomorphism between the probability spaces
(I0, I0, /afii98380) and (I, I, /afii9838). Similarly, there is a probability space(I × /afii98210, I ⊠F0, /afii9838⊠P0)
such that the mapping (/afii9850,id /afii98210 ) is an isomorphism between the probability spaces(I0 ×
/afii98210, I0 ⊠F0, /afii98380 ⊠P0) and (I × /afii98210, I ⊠F0, /afii9838⊠P0), where id/afii98210 is the identity mapping
on /afii98210.F o r(i, /afii9853) ∈ I × /afii98210, let g(i, /afii9853) =¯g(/afii9850(i), /afii9853). Then g is an I ⊠F0-measurable
process whose random variables are mutually independent with uniform distribution/afii9848.I t
is clear that (I × /afii98210, I ⊠F0, /afii9838⊠P0) extends the usual product and retains the Fubini
property.
Deﬁne a mapping /afii9852from (/afii98210, F0,P 0) to /afii9806such that /afii9852(/afii9853) is the sample function g/afii9853
on I . Note that /afii9852may not be one-to-one. For any i1,...,i n in I and for any Borel sets
B1,...,B n on R, let H be the cylinder of all functions y ∈ /afii9806such that y(ik) ∈ Bk for
1 ⩽k ⩽n. Then, /afii9852−1(H ) ={ /afii9853∈ /afii98210 :∀ k = 1,...,n , g ik (/afii9853) ∈ Bk}, which is F0-
measurable. By the i.i.d. assumption ong, P0(/afii9852−1(H ))= ∏ n
k=1 /afii9848(Bk) = /afii9839(H ). Deﬁne
F ={ D ⊆ /afii9806: /afii9852−1(D) ∈ F0}. Then F is a /afii9846-algebra that contains all the cylindersH and
hence the product/afii9846-algebra A. Deﬁne a measureP on F such that P( D )= P0(/afii9852−1(D))
for D ∈ F. Since P and /afii9839agree on all the cylinders (which form a /afii9843-system), P is an
extension of /afii9839by the uniqueness of measures (two probability measures that agree on a
/afii9843-system D must agree on/afii9846(D); see [8, p. 44]).
Now let/afii9820be the mapping fromI × /afii98210 to I × /afii9806by letting /afii9820(i, /afii9853) = (i, /afii9852(/afii9853)). Deﬁne
I ⊠F ={ E ⊆ I × /afii9806: /afii9820−1(E) ∈ I ⊠F0}, and a set function/afii9838⊠P on I ⊠F such that
/afii9838⊠P( E)= /afii9838⊠P0(/afii9820−1(E)) for E ∈ I ⊠F. Then I ⊠F is a /afii9846-algebra that contains the
rectangles A × D for A ∈ I and D ∈ F and hence the product /afii9846-algebra I ⊗ F; since
/afii9838⊠P( A× D) = /afii9838(A)P0(/afii9852−1(D)) = /afii9838⊗ P( A× D), /afii9838⊠P is thus an extension of/afii9838⊗ P
on I ⊗ F.
Since the Fubini property holds on(I × /afii98210, I ⊠F0, /afii9838⊠P0) with marginal measures/afii9838
and P0, it also holds on(I × /afii9806, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) with marginal measures/afii9838and P.
By the deﬁnition of (I × /afii9806, I ⊠F, /afii9838⊠P) , any real-valued function /afii9825on I × /afii9806is
I ⊠F-measurable if and only if/afii9825◦ /afii9820is I ⊠F0-measurable. For the processf deﬁned by
the coordinate functions on/afii9806, it is obvious thatf ◦ /afii9820(i, /afii9853) = f( i ,/afii9852(/afii9853)) = /afii9852(/afii9853)(i) =
g/afii9853(i) = g for all (i, /afii9853) ∈ I × /afii9806. The fact thatg is I ⊠F0-measurable implies that f is
I ⊠F-measurable. Thus, the processf has mutually independent random variables with
45 The existence of such a process¯g is easy. One can simply take the transfer{/afii9826n}n∈∗Z+ of a sequence{/afii9826n}n∈Z+
of i.i.d. random variables with uniform distribution/afii9848. For an unlimited hyperﬁnite integer/afii9845, letI0 ={ 1, 2,..., /afii9845}
be endowed with the counting probability measure on its internal subsets. Its corresponding Loeb space is denoted
by (I
0, I0, /afii98380).F o ri0 ∈ I0, let ¯gi0 be ◦/afii9826i0 . Then this process ¯g satisﬁes the property. See also[4] for another
construction.
